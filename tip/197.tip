~Abstract

This TIP proposes a simple extension to the Tk text widget to allow
the insertion cursor to persist when the window containing the text
widget does not have focus.

~Rationale

In some cases it is useful to redirect text from one top-level window
into a separate top-level window containing a text widget.  In such a
case, it is helpful to be able to see the cursor in the text widget.
However, as implemented, the Tk text widget always erases the insert
cursor when the window loses focus.  It is a trivial fix to add an
option '''-insertpersist''' to the text widget that keeps the text
cursor in the window.

~Specification

The extension would provide a global '''text''' widget option
'''-insertpersist''' with a boolean value.  The current behaviour
would be the default.

 > '''text''' ''tk_path'' '''-insertpersist''' [['''true'''|'''false''']]

~Reference Implementation

[[To come.]]
