# Abstract

This tip proposes listing of available layouts in ttk::theme

# Rationale
  
inside a theme I can ask for known layouts but cannot ask for all other predefined layouts like I can ask for all predefined elements:  
  
  
`ttk::style element names`  
  
` ... Vertical.Scale.slider Horizontal.Scrollbar.thumb downarrow Combobox.field sizegrip ...`  
  
  
  
  
Inside a ttk::style I can add a new layout, e.g.:  
`ttk::style layout \`  
` Left.Accordion {`   
`    Button.button -children {`  
`        Left.Accordion.focus  -children {`  
`            Left.Accordion.padding -children {`  
`                Left.Accordion.label -sticky w`   
`            }}}}`    
  
I can test the layout in query this layout by its name:
   
`ttk::style layout Left.Accordion`  
` ... Button.button -sticky nswe -children {Left.Accordion.focus -sticky nswe -children {Left.Accordion.padding -sticky nswe -children {Left.Accordion.label -sticky w}}}` 
   
or test it by using it in a ttk widget   
`ttk::button    parent.bt  -text "button" -style Left.AccordionButton`  
  
  
the issue:
  
* if the layout does not exist I get an error.
  
  
# Expected Feature
  
I want to check if my prefered theme does provide all the required layouts of my gui.
  
  
# Proposal
  
I expect something like this  
`ttk::style layout names`  
  
  
# Impact
  
* This feature gives me the opportunity to introspect my theme.
* This feature will gives me together with the other arguments of the ttk::style commands the opportunity to compare different themes.  
* This feature will also make it easier to clone a style and to modify it.
