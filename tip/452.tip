~ Abstract

This TIP proposes an enhancement to the '''tcltest''' package to add support
for easy creation of test stubs and test seams.

~ Rationale

The '''tcltest''' package allows for automated testing of Tcl code.  To do
proper automated unit test requires that the unit under test (i.e., the method
or procedure) not invoke the actual implmentation of other units, but rather
should invoke stub or mock units that are under the control of the test being
performed as to the results they return and any exceptions they raise.

~ Proposal

That a package implementing the framework to easily create test stubs/mocks of
Tcl commands be added to the '''tcltest'' package.  Additionaly, to facilitate
creation of automated test for legacy Tcl code, commands supporting ''test
seam'' creation and specification would also be included proposed package.

''Detailed description to follow.''

~ Reference Implementation

''In process of acceptance into Tcl source tree.''
