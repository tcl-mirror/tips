# Abstract

This TIP allows Tk widgets which have a configurable _-state_ option
to accept _enabled_ as a synonym for _normal_.

# Rationale

Tk widgets which have a configurable _-state_ option have \(at a
minimum\) _normal_ and _disabled_ states.  In common usage,
however, the antonym of _disabled_ is _enabled_, not _normal_.

Even experienced Tcl/Tk programmers sometimes forget, though they
usually won't come out and admit it explicitly.  \(Cf.

# Proposed Changes

Modify all Tk widgets which have a configurable _-state_ option to
accept _enabled_ as a synonym for _normal_.  The value returned by
a widget's _cget_ method would continue to be _normal_.  The
appropriate man pages and test suite will be updated to document and
test the use of _enabled_ as a synonym.

	% $w configure -state enabled
	% puts [$w cget -state]
	normal

# Implementation

A reference implementation will be provided shortly.
