# Abstract

It is proposed that each mouse wheel tick executed on a notebook tab area will show the previous or next window.

# Specification

If the mouse pointer is over the tab area of a ttk::notepad:

   *   Moving the mousewheel down will activate the previous tab.
   *   Moving the mousewheel up will activate the next tab.

This should happen for vertical and horizontal mousewheel operation, like in the scrollbar.
The horizontal mousewheel is bound to Shift-Mousewheel.
Some special mices invoke this bining directly by a tiltable scrollwheel.

# Rationale

I have seen that somewhere and I find it very handy. Try it out:

<pre>
ttk::bindMouseWheel TNotebook { ttk::notebook::CycleTab %W }
pack [ttk::notebook .n]
for {set index 1} {$index < 10} {incr index} {
    ttk::label .n.$index -text "Page $index"
    .n add .n.$index -text "tab $index"
}
</pre>

This works for me on Tk8.6.10 on Windows.

For me, this is very handy and intuitive.

# Reference Implementation

Csaba provided the line:

<pre>
ttk::bindMouseWheel TNotebook { ttk::notebook::CycleTab %W }
</pre>

which activates this functionality.

There is a Tk branch tip591 including this functionality.
