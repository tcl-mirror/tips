# Abstract

The ability to initialize just the lower level Tcl subsystems used to be part
of the public API, now it is no longer exposed. This TIP proposes that it be
re-exposed.

# Rationale

Some parts of Tcl's API are useful in portable applications even without
creating a Tcl interpreter; examples of this include Tcl\_Alloc and \(most of\)
the Tcl\_DString-related functions. In order to use these functions correctly,
the Tcl library _must_ be initialized, yet the function for doing so -
Tcl\_InitSubsystems \(currently TclInitSubsystems\) - was removed from Tcl's API;
using Tcl\_FindExecutable instead feels incorrect as we're not seeking to make
the name of the executable available to Tcl scripts.

# Proposed Change

A new function Tcl\_InitSubsystems, similar to the internal TclInitSubsystems,
should be exposed as alternative to Tcl\_FindExecutable in Tcl's C API. This
will _not_ be a part of the Stub API; it is not intended to ever be used
from an initialized stubbed environment, as it is meant to be used prior to
the stub table being available. It has a single argument, _panicProc_.
When NULL, the default panic function is used. The full signature is:

 > EXTERN const char \*
   **Tcl\_InitSubsystems**\(
       Tcl\_PanicProc \*_panicProc_\);

The return value of _Tcl\_InitSubsystems_ is the Tcl version.

# Reference Implementation

A reference implementation is available in the **initsubsystems** branch.
