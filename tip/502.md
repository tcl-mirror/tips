# Abstract

Proposes reformed handling of Tcl index values.

# Background

Many Tcl programmers may be surprised by this result

	% lindex {a b} -4294967295
	b

This is the consequence of two features of incumbent Tcl
functionality. First, passing the value "-4294967295" to
_Tcl\_GetInt\(FromObj\)_ results in a successful extraction
of the C __int__ value __1__. Generally any supported formatting
of any value between __-UINT\_MAX__ and __UINT\_MAX__ is accepted,
but transformed into a value between __INT\_MIN__ and __INT\_MAX__.
Second, the internal routine/macro _TclGetIntForIndex\(M\)_
implements a definition of Tcl index values where any value acceptable
to _Tcl\_GetInt\(FromObj\)_ is also acceptable as an index of the
same value.  Both of these features are of questionable merit, but
the first has a fair bit of compatibility constraint attached to it
because it involves the behavior of public routines.  The second
should be more open to potential revisions.

Another source of possible surprise is demonstrated:

	% lindex {a b} 4294967295
	% lindex {a b} 4294967295+1
	a
	% lindex {a b} 4294967296
	bad index "4294967296": must be integer?[+-]integer? or end?[+-]integer?
