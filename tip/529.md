# Abstract

An additional property is proposed for photo images to hold image metadata:

    myimage cget -metadata
    myimage configure -metadata [dict create dpi 300.0]

# Rationale

Image files may contain a lot of metadata like resolution, comments, GPS location etc.
This metadata should be accessable and setable for the following aims:

   *   Make it available after image load on script level
   *   Make it setable within the image
   *   Write it in the image file.
   *   Prepare eventual automations on automatic scaling on screen resolution

This TIP specially targets the resolution (DPI) value of the image.

The image resolution included in an image file is crucial for its usage, as many applications (word & co.) use this field to calculate a default size.
One may enjoy, that image files used in pdf4tcl are automatically scaled at the right resolution (e.g. the resolution saved in the image file).

This information is included in png files (supported by tk core) and many other image formats included in the Img patch.

I authored an extension to the Img patch to specify the dpi field of a bmp file on file writing. The syntax was accorded with Jeff Hobbs:

    myimage write file.bmp -format [list bmp -resolution 300 i]

This may be expressed (when all packages are adopted) by:

    myimage configure -metadata [dict create dpi 300.0]
    myimage write file.bmp

# Specification

## Metadata Dict

The propery "**-metadata**" is added to each image.  It contains a dictionary,
where the keys of the dictionary are specific to each photo image format.

The following default keys are used by Tk's built in photo image formats, if the
corresponding data is present:

| Key     | Description      | Example image formats |
|:-------:|:----------------:|:---------------------:|
| `dpi`     | Image resolution | png                   |
| `comment` | Text comment     | gif                   |
| `xmp`     | xmp image data   | png                   |

If a particular image does not specify any keys (whether during creation or
otherwise) then the dictionary will be empty.

## Commands

The following commands are directly concerned:

    image create photo myimage -metadata $metadict
    myimage cget -metadata
    myimage configure -metadata $metadict

It is also OK to store application data related to the image within the
property dict. A widget may store special properties; Tk will store and return
values it does not recognise, but otherwise will ignore them.

Any load and save command may use the content of the metadata dict.  This may
be an ongoing process, specially within the Img patch.

The commands are:

    image create photo myimage -file myfile.bmp
    myimage configure -file myfile.bmp
    myimage write file.bmp

The **image create** and file loading functions recreate the metadata dict.
Any current contents is lost.

The **write** method uses any dict keys it knows.  Any unknown dict keys
are ignored.

## C Interface

The current C interface for drivers and other programs is not sufficient to
support the metadata dict.

A new extensible interface is envisaged with:

   *   a pair of functions to get or set all options of the image.
   *   a new driver interface to basically only pass the command.
   *   and a compatibility layer to the current driver interface

There are currently functions to access the raster data (`Tk_PhotoGetImage`,
`Tk_PhotoPutBlock`).  The other properties (**-file**, **-data**, **-format**,
**-gamma**) are not exposed.

A new interface may also be used for other image formats like SVG where the
image data consists of the rastered image, the image data and metadata.  In
this case, an image save operation might even not use the raster data but only
metadata and image data.

### Image Property get and set Functions

Two new stub table functions are added:

 1.  Tcl\_Obj \* **Tk\_PhotoGetOption**(Tk\_PhotoHandle _handle_, const char \*_OptionName_)

    This retrieves the current value of an option.

 2. void **Tk\_PhotoSetOption**(Tk\_PhotoHandle _handle_, const char \*_OptionName_, Tcl\_Obj \*_optionValue_)

    This updates or creates the value of an option.

### Revised Image Driver Commands

The new command interface only passes the image handle. Any required data may
be accquired by the get/set functions. Also, access to the raster data is done
by the raster access functions.

The current registration function is

    Tk_CreatePhotoImageFormat()

...

# Implementation

The current implementation is only a sketch in my brain.
I hope, that an image handler can set the options after reading and a binary extension of the image handlers is not necessary.
Nevertheless, I don't know jet.

Any help and comments are appreciated.
I am realy a novice here.

Implementation may start soon with the tag tip-529-image-metadata.

# Rejected Alternatives

## C interface: only use metadata dict get and set functions

Two new stub table functions are added:

    Tcl_Obj * Tk_PhotoGetMetadata(Tk_PhotoHandle handle)

    void Tk_PhotoSetMetadata(Tk_PhotoHandle handle, Tcl_Obj *metadata)

This works well for image read. The function "Tk_PhotoSetMetadata" is called within the image read function.

But it is not suitable for image write, as the required photo handle is not passed into the write functions:

    static int CommonWriteGIF(Tcl_Interp *interp,
            const char *fileName,
            WriteBytesFunc *writeProc,
            Tcl_Obj *format,
            Tk_PhotoImageBlock *blockPtr);

In consequence, the write function should be extended by the metadata object pointer.

# Discussion

## Buffer the svg spline data to avoid double-parsing

Another aim I want to reach with this TIP is to find a way to avoid multiple-parsing of svg files. The used svg routines from the nanosvg project split svg processing into two steps:

   *   Step 1: transform the xml data to a binary representation of the splines
   *   Step 2: render the splines to an image presentation

When svg files are loaded by:

    image create photo i1 -file test.svg -format {svg -scaletoheight 16}

then the file is accessed and the xml data loaded and processing step 1 and 2 is performed.

When the image is scaled by:

    i1 configure -format {svg -scaletoheight 32}

then the same steps are performed as on image load, while only step 2 would be necessary.
Performance is poor and the file must still be available.

My plan is to store the binary representation of the splines (result of processing step 1) as a key of **-metadata** (say splinesblob) and to acheve to only perform step 2 on scaling.

In addition, svg image may even "compiled" to the metadata structure, so the following command may work:

    image create i1 -metadata {splineblob ...} -format {svg -scaletoheight 32}

This will only work within the same patchlevel of TK, as the format may change, but it may be useful for example when packing to a starkit.

In my talk on ETCL 2019, I showed an Android GUI where buttons may be scaled by a pinch to zoom gesture. The current performance is quite poor.
