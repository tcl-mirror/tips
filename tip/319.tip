~ Abstract

This TIP calls for the implementation of backward compatibility between ttk
themed widgets and conventional tk widgets. It does this by describing
configuration options that specify how to deal with unsupported options
(error, ignore, or call supplied callbacks) where full compatibility is not
feasible. Configuration should be both global (all widgets) and specific (by
class or individual widget).
