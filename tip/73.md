# Abstract

This TIP proposes that the existing _TclpGetTime_ function be
renamed to be _Tcl\_GetTime_ and included in the published API.

# Rationale

The Tcl library provides a uniform abstraction, _TclpGetTime_ that
is implemented on each of the platforms to retrieve absolute time in a
_Tcl\_Time_ object.  This function is highly useful outside the Tcl
library itself, since it hides a very complex set of interfaces,
particularly on Windows, where several hundred lines of code enable
its use for high-precision measurements.  For this reason, it ought to
be made part of the public API.

# Proposed Change

The existing _TclpGetTime_ procedure shall be renamed to be
_Tcl\_GetTime_, and its declaration shall be added to
_tcl.decls_.

	 void TclpGetTime( Tcl_Time* timePtr );

A definition of _TclpGetTime_ as a stub procedure that simply
invokes _Tcl\_GetTime_ shall be retained in _tclInt.decls_ for
compatibility with existing Stubs-enabled extensions that invoke it.

This change requires no other change to the public headers; the
_Tcl\_Time_ structure is already exported in _tcl.h_.
