# Abstract

This proposal will add basic support for mounting zip archive files as virtual
filesystems to the Tcl core.

# Target Tcl-Version

This TIP targets TCL Version 8.7 or 9.0, whatever comes first.

# Rationale

Tcl/Tk relies on the presence of a file system containing Tcl scripts for
bootstrapping the interpreter.  When dealing with code packed in a
self-contained executable, a chicken-and-egg problem arises when developers
try to provide this bootstrap from their attached VFS with extensions like
TclVfs.  TclVfs runs in the Tcl interpreter.  The interpreter needs
_init.tcl_, which would mean that the filesystem containing _init.tcl_ is
not present until after TclVfs mounts it yet that mount cannot happen until
after _init.tcl_ has been loaded. Bootstrap filesystem mounts require
built-in support for the filesystem that they use.

With the inclusion of Zlib in the core \(starting with 8.6, [[244]](244.md)\), all that is
required to implement a zip file system based VFS is to add a C-level VFS
implementation to decode the zip archive format. Thus: this project.

Note that we are prioritizing the zip archive format also because it is
practical to generate the files without a Tcl installation being present; it
is a format with widespread OS support. This makes it much easier to bootstrap
a build of Tcl that uses it without requiring a native build of tclsh to be
present.

# Specification

There shall be new commands added to safe interpreters withing Tcl. All of which 
shall be in the **::zvfs** namespace. These commands shall include:

 * **zvfs::mount** ?_archive_? ?_mountpoint_?

	 > Mounts the ZIP file _archive_ at the location given by _mountpoint_,
   which will default to **zipfs:_/_archive_ if absent. With no arguments
   this command describes all current mounts, returning a list of pairs.

 * **zvfs::unmount** _archive_

	 > Unmounts the ZIP file _archive_, which must have been previously mounted.

Safe interpreters will not be given the mount or unmount commands. 
Already mounted file systems will be available via the **glob** and **file**
commands. These commands, and any commands related to building
archives will be marked with the unsafe bit within the **zipfs** ensemble,
and will be removed from any interpreter through the normal mechanism
to hide unsafe commands within the core.

# Implementation

I have adapted Richard Hipp's work on Tcl As One Big Executable \(TOBE\) to
operate inside of a modern Tcl. That implementation consists of one C file
\(_tclZipvfs.c_\).  I have also prepared new behaviors for inside of
Tcl\_AppInit\(\) to detect if a zip filesystem is attached to the current
executable, and how to extract a "_main.tcl_" as well as the initial file
systems for both Tcl and Tk.

This work is checked in as the "_core\_zip\_vfs_" branch on both Tcl and Tk.

# C API

* **int TclZipfsInit\(Tcl\_Interp \*interp\);**
	> Initializes the C API for Zipfs. If called with a non-null _interp_, adds the commands
   for the zipfs Tcl API to the interpreter. Returns **TCL\_OK** on success, and **TCL\_ERROR** in  
   all other cases.

* **int TclZipfsMount\(Tcl\_Interp \*interp, const char \*zipname, const char \*mntpt, const char \*passwd\);**
	> Mounts a zip file _zipname_ to the mount point _mntpt_. If _passwd_ is non-null, that string is
   utilized as the password to decrypt the contents. _mnpnt_ will always be relative to **zipfs:**

* **int TclZipfsUnmount\(Tcl\_Interp \*interp, const char \*zipname\);**
	> Unmount the file system created by a prior call to **TclZipfsMount\(\)**

# Bootstraping

The mount and unmount commands are usable within the core as just another feature engine. A call to TclZipfsInit\(\) will be inserted into tclBasic.c, immediately after the code to initialize zlib.

A modified shell \(tclkit.exe\) will be generated by Make. This shell will:
* Check if the executable has a zip archive attached. If so, that 
archive shall be mounted as **zipfs:/app**. 
* If _zipfs:/app" is present the interpreter will look for 
**boot/tcl/init.tcl**. If that file is present, the location for **$tcl\_library**
will be set to **zipfs:/app/boot/tcl**.
* If _zipfs:/app_ is present the interpreter will look for **boot/tk/tk.tcl'. If present
the location for **$tk\_library** will be set to **zipfs:/boot/tk**. 
* If the file **pkgIndex.tcl** is present, the **$dir** variable will be set to
**zipfs:/app** and the file will be sourced as if it were a package index.
* If the file **main.tcl** is present, the file **zipfs://app/main.tcl** will be registered with **Tcl\_SetStartupScript\(\)**
