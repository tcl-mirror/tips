~ Abstract

This TIP proposes to add a '''::tcl::errorStack''' variable giving a
"substituted" traceback similar to Python's or gdb's ones.

~ Background

The ::errorInfo variable is a valuable tool for debugging; however, it yields
mostly static information regarding each level of procedure call, as it only
gives the static text (extracted from the source) at the call site. This leads
to frustrating situations, like when an error occurs at a deep level of a
recursive function, ''::errorInfo'' repeatedly reporting "f $x [[foo
[[bar]]]]" or similar un-substituted commands. In other languages, the
traceback is more useful in that it contains the actual values passed as
arguments.

~ Proposed Change

This TIP proposes to create a '''::tcl::errorStack''' variable which is a list
of lists, made of the [['''info level''' 0]] lists of command-and-args at each
proc level at the time of error unwinding.

~ Rationale

In a natural implementation, its construction is analogous to ::errorInfo's,
which is built incrementally, one level at a time while popping back from the
error site.  The only differences are that (1) dynamic arglists (from [info
level 0]) are stored, (2) the result is a true list built by '''lappend''',
and (3) the granularity is coarser than ::errorInfo's since there is just one
element per proc level (and not for intervening '''while''' or '''foreach'''
constructs) and no adornment like "... while executing ..." .

The performance hit of maintaining ::errorStack should be very small, since
basically it amounts to growing a (usually short) list whose elements are
already existing Tcl_Obj's (the [['''info level''' 0]] lists).

However, if it proves necessary to provide an on/off switch, one can imagine a
::tcl::useErrorStack boolean linked var.

~ Reference Implementation

A C reference implementation will be provided shortly.  In the meantime, a
pure-Tcl proof of concept based on write traces on ::errorInfo can be found at
