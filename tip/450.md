# Abstract

This TIP proposes a simpler extension of the **binary** command than the related
[[418]](418.md), namely just a subcommand **set** that updates an existing byte array
in a variable instead of creating a new one like **binary format**. It does
not propose an extension of the various formatting codes.

# Rationale

As already argued in [[418]](418.md), the **binary** command is efficient in creating
new objects of binary data or in parsing existing objects with such data. It
is not currently efficient in _updating_ existing objects. However, such
data objects are commonly used by compiled extensions.

As a consequence, if you want to manipulate such data objects from Tcl
directly, it is easier to parse the object into, say, a list of numbers, use
list commands like **lset** to replace individual values and pack it into a
new binary array before passing it to a compiled extension.

# Specification

This TIP proposes to add a subcommand **set** to the **binary** command
with the following signature:

 > **binary set** _varName formatString arg1 arg2 arg3 ..._

The effect of this subcommand is that the byte array data contained in the
variable "varName" is updated in a manner analogous to **lset**, but using a
format string like **binary format**. It could be implemented in Tcl as:

 > set varName [binary format "a*$formatString" $varName $arg1 $arg2 $arg3 ...]

except that this allocates a new block of memory, sets that to null, copies
the contents of _varName_ into that new block and then does the update.

The new command will have the effect that the first few steps are not
necessary anymore.

# Implementation Notes

Besides the nominal case of a variable that contains a binary array that is to
be updated within the bounds of that array, four other cases exist and need
to be prepared for:

 * The variable _varName_ does not exist yet: we must create the
   variable when writing back the binary value.

 * The variable _varName_ does not contain a binary string: we must
   convert the variable to a binary string (using the usual algorithm).

 * The variable _varName_ contains a binary string that is shared with
   other uses (such as being stored in other variables): we must
   duplicate the binary string in this case before updating it.

 * The updating would go past the memory allocated for the binary
   array: we must extend the binary array.
   
_It is the Tcl programmer's responsibility to avoid these cases if they
matter to them._ The **binary set** command will act in accordance
with existing Tcl standard semantics.
