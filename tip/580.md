# Abstract

Export 6 new functions through the public stub table.

# Rationale

Those exports are meant to be used by the revised\_text widget. The reason this new text replacement widget
is currently integrated into Tk (in a separate branch) is because Tk doesn't export some symbols needed by
revised\_text. Those 6 additional exports allow revised\_text to be compiled separate from Tk.

# Specification

The following 5 functions are exported through the public stub table:

  * `int Tk_AlwaysShowSelection(Tk_Window)`
  * `unsigned Tk_GetButtonMask(unsigned)`
  * `int Tk_GetDoublePixelsFromObj(Tcl_Interp *, Tk_Windows, Tcl_Obj *, double *)`
  * `Tcl_Obj *Tk_NewWindowObj(Tk_Windows)`
  * `void Tk_SendVirtualEvent(Tk_Windows, const char *, Tcl_Obj *)`

They are currently available from `tkInt.h` as (`MODULE_SCOPE`) functions: `TkpAlwaysShowSelection`,
`TkGetButtonMask`, `Tk_GetDoublePixelsFromObj`, `TkNewWindowObj`, `TkSendVirtualEvent`.

One more new function:

  * `Tcl_Obj *Tk_FontGetDescription(Tk_Font tkfont)`

The implementation is a simplified version of the revised\_text `TkFontGetDescription()` function.

# Compatibility

This is 100% upwards compatible.

# Implementation

See the [`tip-580`](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tk/timeline?r=tip-580) branch.
