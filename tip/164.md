# Abstract

This TIP proposes to add a _rotate_ subcommand to the canvas widget
to facilitate rotating items in very much the same way as is now
possible with scaling and moving.

# Rationale

The canvas currently allows a programmer to scale and move items, but
the third common affine transformation, rotation, is not supported.
This can in itself be simulated by a script \(simply get the
coordinates of all items involved, transform them and set the new
coordinates\), but if you have several hundreds or even thousands of
items this gets very slow.

Rotation is easy for polygons and lines: simply transform the
coordinates.  For circles and circular arcs new bounding boxes must be
calculated and in addition for arcs the starting angle must be
changed.

Implementing rotation should consider what to do with items that can
not \(easily\) be rotated: text items, rectangles, non-circular ovals
and arcs, widgets and images.  Currently, text can not be drawn at an
arbitrary angle, so I propose to only transform the coordinates at
which the text is "anchored".  A similar strategy can be used for
widgets and images.

For rectangles and general ovals and arcs there are two choices:

 * Transforming the item into a polygon would solve the definition
   problem \(these items are defined by a bounding box and the
   orientation is implicitly assumed\), but might break scripts that
   look for a particular type of item.

 * Therefore we will simply calculate a new bounding box and _ignore
   changes in orientation_.

# Proposal

Canvases will have a new subcommand, **rotate**, which will rotate the coordinates of chosen items by a specified angle about a specified point.

 > _canvas_ **rotate** _itemOrTag_ _x_ _y_ _angle_

Note that most of the arguments are very similar to the canvas's **scale** subcommand.  _Angle_ is measured in degrees, with positive values indicating anti-clockwise rotation.

## Canvas Item C API Alterations

[These are required for this TIP, but are not yet done.]

# Reference Implementation

A reference implementation does _not_ yet exist.

# Future Work

Should we also consider the possibility of reflections in a line?

Should we also consider more general linear transformations \(to be specified via a 2x2 matrix\)?  What about full affine transformations \(i.e. with the translation components\)?

If we implement these from the start, we need to do only a little more
work.

# Comments

It might be useful to utilize the -anchor Tk option in all canvas items and add a new "-anchoroffset $x,$y" option, where $x $y be canvas distances relevant to the anchor position. Once defined, or with their default values, the -anchor and -anchoroffset values combined will provide the item's center, for placement and rotation purposes. Item sets, constituting symbols, can then be manipulated easily.

It could probably be beneficial to add an -angle option \(and an accomplanying -angleunit one\), to persist a rotation angle in the configuration database. The presence of an angle value other than zero would help negate rotation, thus re-instating the item to its initial orientation.
