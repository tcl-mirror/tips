# Abstract

Every once in a while there is a request to be able to compile Tcl with a C++ compiler. This
would - in theory - allow C++ exceptions thrown by extensions to be handled by Tcl. This TIP
is _NOT_ about adding any code to Tcl doing that. But - as a first step - at least, Tcl needs
to compile well with a C++ compiler even though we don't use any C++ features.

This TIP proposes making Tcl compilable with a C++ compiler, without actually
using any C++ features.

# Implementation

The Tcl source-code has been strictified in the following ways:

 * No C++ keywords are allowed any more, such as `new` or `class`, for variable names.

 * No automatic casts from `(void *)` to other types any more, so all malloc's must be
   preceded by a type casts. And a `clientData` variable cannot be assigned directly
   any more to a variable of another type. This situation requires a type cast from
   now on in the Tcl core.

 * Travis build sections are added, which compile Tcl with g++ (UNIX/Windows). So,
   any future commit which violates C++ compilation will lead to a failed build.

Nothing is done yet in the Tcl code to handled C++ exception, neither is any of the
API now available as C++ classes.

Tk has a `cplusplus` branch as well, doing the same. This work is complete for
UNIX, but not yet for Windows and MacOSX.
