~ Abstract

This TIP proposes the use of PURLs to unify the scattered landscape of
Tcl URLs into a coherent set of information about the language, the
community, extensions, etc.

~ Background & Rationale

One of the recurring themes in the community in general (and
news:comp.lang.tcl in particular) is the lack of central website
people can turn to for an introduction to the language, the community,
search for extensions and packages, et cetera.

Most of the solutions proposed so far have the distinctive
disadvantage of not being able to use the existing sites and bind them
into a whole. This is further aggravated by the fact that the
'natural' domain names, like for example http://www.tcl.com/ and
http://www.tcl.org are already taken by other entities, commercial and
not, and thus not available anymore.  We do have control of the http://www.tcl-tk.net/ domain, provided by David Welton.

Instead of giving up at this point I propose to use PURLs a.k.a.
''Persistent URLs'' to construct a virtual website (the ''Tcl space'')
out of all the existing independent efforts. See http://www.purl.org/
for more explanations of PURLs.

Note that PURLs not only can refer to single URLs but to entire
sites. The latter is done through a technique called 'partial
redirection'. This ... is emphasized here because partially redirected
PURL have to be used with a trailing slash whereas PURLs referring to
single URL must not have a trailing slash.

In the lists below partially redirected PURLs are indicated by a
trailing slash.

A restriction we face is that PURLs are case insensitive. This means
that the names we will have to come up with have to be unique even
with case removed.

One of the most important features is the persistency. In real life
however organizations, people, websites, etc. can disappear. According
to http://www.purl.org/OCLC/PURL/FAQ#toc3.14 the PURL stays in
existence but can be redirected to a page detailing the history of the
purl. This would include the decommission. We could also do our own
scheme and redirect the purl to a page explaining the history in a
more Tcl-specific manner (like: Company went out of business, was
acquired, etc.).

~ Specification

This TIP is driven by several conflicting needs:

   * The names will be persistent, so give them some thought before
     creating them; they cannot be undone. This also implies that we
     to set up a simple and minimal structure first so as not to block
     future enhancements and flexibility.

   * Define the structure now before the URN space gets as scattered
     as the URL space is. Note that this process has already
     begun. The PURL resolver at http://www.purl.org/ currently has
     registered 24 Tcl-related PURLs which are not bound together in
     the framework proposed here. Action is necessary to prevent
     further confusion.

Of the existing PURLs the PURL domain ''/tcl'' created by Don Libes is
the most promising one for the unification of the Tcl space. Six of
the 24 aforementioned PURLs are defined below this domain too,
providing a (good) framework on which to build.

The existing PURLs and sub-domains in the ''/tcl'' domain are:

   * ''expect''	- reference to the homepage of the expect extension

   * ''faq''	- reference to the main FAQ

   * ''faqs''	- introduction to the available FAQ documents.

   * ''home/''	- refers to the Tcl Developers Xchange

   * ''tip/''	- refers to the TIP archives

   * ''wiki''	- refers to the entry page of the Tcl'ers WIKI

With the exception of ''expect'' all of these are general classes
and/or refer to important sites. They are used as is, except for
''expect'' which has to be redirected into the proposed sub-domain
''package''.

The following new sub-domains covering the most important general
classes of information and/or websites are proposed here. Please note
that the examples used in the list below are using purely informal
everyday names to refer to entities in the proposed domain. These
examples should not be seen as suggestions for the concrete naming
scheme used by the domain.

   * ''announce'' - Direct reference to a page explaining how to
     announce packages, applications and other tcl-related news and
     linking to the relevant newsgroups, mail archives and submission
     addresses. This includes, but is not restricted to:

   > * A link to the newsgroup ''comp.lang.tcl.announce''.

   > * A link to the eGroups/Yahoo archive of the c.l.t.a newsgroup.

   > * The submission address of c.l.t.a. to directly submit via email
       announcements.

   * ''newsletter'' - Direct reference to an archive of ''Tcl-URL!''.

   * ''package/'' - Sub-domain to contain references to the homepages
     of the known packages. This TIP makes no distinction between
     C-level extensions and script libraries. From the point of view
     of the core these are all packages to be required.

   > Examples of packages are ''Expect'', ''tcllib'', etc.

   * ''application/'' - Sub-domain to contain references to the
     homepages of applications related to Tcl, written in Tcl or using
     it internally.

   > Examples of applications are ''frink'', ''tclHttpd'',
     ''AOLServer'', etc.

   * ''person/'' - Sub-domain to contain references to the homepages of
     people active in the community, as far as they are interested in
     such a reference. References in this domain shall be personal and
     not organization-related. The latter will go into their own
     domain.

   > Examples of people are ''Larry Virden'', ''Cameron Laird'', etc.

   * ''org/'' - Sub-domain to contain references to organizations
     important to the Tcl community.

   > Examples are the Tcl Core Team, the Tcl Core Maintainers,
     Tcl-based based companies (PhaseIt, ActiveState), companies and
     organizations using Tcl (NIST, CAS), etc.

~ Management

The ''/tcl'' domain was created by Don Libes which made him
automatically the maintainer of the domain (see
http://www.purl.org/maint/search_user.pl.cgi?userid=^LIBES$). He has
already extended the maintainership to the entity TCLGROUP (see
http://www.purl.org/maint/search_group.pl.cgi?groupid=^TCLGROUP$),
currently consisting of

   * Gordon Johnstone <gordonjohnstone@earthling.net>

   * Jeffrey Hobbs <jeff@hobbs.org>

   * Don Libes <libes@nist.gov>

   * Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

   * Larry Virden <lvirden@yahoo.com>

   * Don G. Porter <dgp@nist.giv>

   * Jean-Claude Wippler <jcw@equi4.com>

For the future I propose that

   * High-level changes to the Tcl space, like new sub-domains, have to
     go through the TCT and the TIP process for approval. This is also
     in line with [0] declaring the responsibility of the TCT for the
     Tcl webspace.

   * The day-to-day routine of adding new packages, persons,
     organizations, etc. is delegated to a new group, the ''Tcl
     Namespace Maintainers''.

   > Initially this group would consist of the people mentioned above,
     with membership open to volunteers from the community.

~ Discussion

   * All of the newly proposed sub-domains will be simple listings
     mapping from the names of the entities contained in them to the
     proper locations. Further categorization of the entities by
     topic, gender or other attributes is out of the scope of this
     TIP. This type of categorization rather is in the domain of
     general and specialized catalogs which can be set up later and
     then bound into the unified webspace proposed here.

   > Note that such catalogs can and should make use of the proposed
     domains to reduce the effort necessary by them to stay current
     with respect to the location of the referenced entities (people,
     packages, etc).

   * The first pre-draft of this TIP contained definitions for the
     names to use in the various domains. These definitions have been
     removed on the grounds that their format and other issues like
     resolution of naming conflicts, order of precedence, etc. are
     best handled in one or more separate documents. The role of this
     TIP is to lay down a framework within which the community can
     operate and not to fill in every conceivable detail.

   > These details can be discussed and decided upon by the group of
     maintainers proposed in the last section.

   * This proposal makes the Tcl community dependent on an external
     entity, namely the maintainers of http://www.purl.org/. This is
     considered acceptable.

~ Example

The following examples show how to use PURLs, using some of the
already existing ones:

    * http://www.purl.org/tcl/tip/ refers to the TIP archive.

    * http://www.purl.org/tcl/wiki/ refers to the Tcl'ers Wiki.
