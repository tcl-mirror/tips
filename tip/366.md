# Abstract

This TIP is to allow custom sizing of menubutton indicators using
**-indwidth** and **-indheight** as options.

# Rationale

Currently there is no way to vary the size of the indicator for a classic Unix
menubutton widget.  Adding the ability to control this via configuration
options will give the coder more control over a GUI's appearance for when such
fine control is required.

# Specification

The following options are proposed to be added to the **::menubutton**
widget:

 > The **-indwidth** option allows the specification of the width of the
   indicator in 10ths of a mm \(will be converted to an integer number of pixels\).

 > The **-indheight** option allows the specification of the height of the
   indicator in 10ths of a mm \(will be converted to an integer number of pixels\).

# Implementation

A patch exists in SourceForge \(Feature Request 2996760
<https://sourceforge.net/support/tracker.php?aid=2996760> \).
