# Abstract

This TIP proposes a set of new features for the Ttk treeview widget.

# Rationale

Each time I have tried to use the Treeview widget it fell short of some
feature or another and I had to resort to other means.

This aims to fill in the most common missing pieces.

# Specification

The following features are added to the treeview widget.

## Locked horizontal scrolling

Adds the ability to lock the first column(s) from horizontal scrolling.

A new option **-titlecolumns** *n* is added, requesting columns to be locked.
The tree column counts, even if **-show tree** is not specified. Thus for
value N of this option, column #N is the first one that is scrollable.

## Cell selection

Adds the ability to select individual cells as well as full rows.

Cell selection is independent of item selection.

Cells are identified with a two element list with item id and column id.

A new subcommand **cellselection** is added, mirroring the present **selection**.
In addition the **cellselection set** and **cellselection add** commands get
a version for selecting a rectangular range.

A new option **-selecttype** *type* is added to direct default bindings to
use either item selection or cell selection.

The **identify** subcommand is updated with the **cell** option.

Default bindings are updated to use these features.

## Striped rows

A new option **-striped** *bool* is added. This makes every other row get marked
with the `alternate` state, and allows the theme to draw them in a
different color. Built in themes are updated to put something fitting
at that color.

## Column separators

The **-show** option is extended with the value `columnseparators` to
display a separator between columns.
Built in themes are updated to define the separators.

## Image anchor for tree

A new item option **-imageanchor** *anchor* is added.
This controls the placement of the image relative to the text in an
item's tree column. Default is "w".

# Implementation
