# Abstract

This TIP proposed to make the default encoding for the "source" command utf-8

# Rationale

TODO

# Compatibility

For scripts using the ASCII encoding only (as was the only portable way
to write scripts in Tcl 8.x) this is fully upwards compatible. Scripts
assuming a different system encoding than utf-8 will break.

# Implementation

See the [`tip-587`](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tcl/timeline?r=tip-587) branch.
