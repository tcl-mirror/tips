# Abstract

This TIP proposes to use Tcl's package configuration database \(see
[[59]](59.md)\) to register whether Tk was compiled with support for Xft.

# Rationale

As of version 8.5, Tk has optional support for Xft \(the modern
replacement for server-side fonts in X11\).  However, at present
application code has no way to determine whether or not Xft support
was enabled when Tk was built.  The package configuration database
facility introduced in [[59]](59.md) seems like an ideal place to record this
information.

# Proposal

If Tk was configured with _--enable-xft_, the command

	 tk::pkgconfig get fontsystem

shall return the value **xft**.

# Notes

The change as currently proposed is the minimum necessary to satisfy
the requirement listed in the Rationale.  In particular: nothing else
in Tk currently calls _Tcl\_RegisterConfig\(\)_, so if Xft support is
not enabled the **tk::pkgconfig** command will remain undefined.

This TIP \(or something like it\) is a prerequisite for a script-level implementation of [[145]](145.md), which will need to distinguish whether or not Xft is in use.
