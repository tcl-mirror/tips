# Abstract

This TIP proposes to eliminate the long-deprecated _interp_->_result_
field from the public headers.

# Proposal

The include file _tcl.h_ is to be modified so that the _result_ field of
the _Tcl\_Interp_ data structure will be renamed to _unused1_ unless a
preprocessor symbol, **USE\_INTERP\_RESULT** is defined.

Note that this change leaves the _result_ field in the internal _Interp_
data structure untouched, and all the code that manipulates it will still be
there. Stubs compatiblity is thus preserved for extensions that compile
against an 8.5 or earlier code base, and full source-level compatibility is
available with the appropriate preprocessor definition.

# Rationale

The _result_ field in this structure has been deprecated for a decade now,
and yet extensions that use it still turn up. Extension writers need to be put
on sterner notice that it _will_ disappear as soon as Tcl 9.0 development is
open.
