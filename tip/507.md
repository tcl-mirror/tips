# Abstract

Tk needs scalable images on high res mobile devices.

# Rationale

Tk is running on desktop and mobile devices. The out of the box image formats
do not scale and are to tiny on high res mobile devices.
The same goes for the image formats provided by the img extension.

There is already an tk image extension at https://github.com/auriocus/tksvg
The implementation is using nanosvg. It has no other external dependencies
and is only 2 header files.

The original nanosvg project is hosted at https://github.com/memononen/nanosvg

# Specification

The already existing tksvg extension will be adapted and included in Tk.
A new image format will be created. The name is **svgnano**.

# Discussion

- nanosvg is no full svg library
- the name of the image format should mention this (p.e. **nanosvg** or
**svgnano**)
- are there better libraries with our requirements (C only, license)?

# Implementation

A patch implementing these changes will be available in the fossil repository in the [tip-507 branch]
(https://core.tcl.tk/tk/timeline?r=tip-507).

Documentation updates not yet done.

# Alternatives

- using another library with full svg support
