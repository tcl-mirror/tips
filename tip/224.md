# Abstract

The TIP proposes the addition of a new subcommand to the **array**
command: **value**.  The **value** subcommand would query, reference,
and/or initialize an array element with more options for complexity
than a simple read.

# Rationale

[TIP 215](215.md) proposed modifying the **incr** command to auto-initialize
variables which do not exist, rather than throwing an error.  After some
debate, it was identified that frequency counting in arrays was the primary
area of interest.  In particular, the excessive use of `if`/`info exists`
constructs in such code is inefficient, verbose and rather difficult to read.
Though now we have **incr** doing automatic initialization, the addition of an
extra subcommand could substantially reduce the complexity of much Tcl code.

# Specification

A new subcommand will be added to **array**, being **value**.

 > **array value** _var elem_ ?_value_? ?_init_?

The **array value** would just return the current contents of the element
_elem_ of the array called _var_ if it exists, or _value_ otherwise.  If the
_init_ parameter is provided and resolves to true \(as determined by
`Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj()` of course\), the variable is initialized to _value_
if it doesn't already exist.  The default for _value_ is the empty string, and
the default for _init_ is false.

# Reference Implementation

Following is an example Tcl-only implementation of the **value** subcommand:

	proc Array {cmd var elem {amt {}} {init 0}} {
	   # Implement the Array subcmd value on var(elem):
	   #  - value  return the value if defined, else return amt
	   #           initializing if init.
	   upvar $var uvar
	   if {[string match $cmd* value]} {
	      if {[info exists uvar($elem)]} {
	         return $uvar($elem)
	      }
	      if {$init} {
	         return [set uvar($elem) $amt]
	      }
	      return $amt
	   } else {
	      error "usage: Array value var elem ?amt? ?init?"
	   }
	}

# Discussion

 * Wangnic notes:

	\[**array value** _var elem_ **"" false**\] can be written as
	\[**array get** _var elem_\]

	**Array get** returns name/value pairs.  **Array value** returns just the
	value.  Also if _elem_ has a `*` in it, there may be multiple matches.

 * Hobbs notes:

	[TIP 200](200.md) already rejected **array values**

	A single item is returned from **array value**, not a list, as
	there is no string match on elem.

	The problem domain is not list processing \(which is expected to be
	relatively expensive\), but rather frequency counting and set
	matching.

 * RHSeeger notes:

	It would seem more consistant to push for the **incr** command to
	include a way to initialize a variable if it doesn't exist \(as per
	[TIP 215](215.md) or the discussed options contained therein\), rather than add
	an incr subcommand to array.

	Being a fan or reintroducing the **array values** TIP \(since the
	core mailing list indicates it was never fully rejected\), I think
	**array value** might be a bit confusing, being only off by the
	lack of plurality. \(I was one of the people pushing for [TIP 200](200.md)
	though, so take that aspect with a grain of salt\)

 * dkf notes:
 
    The **array incr** command was removed from this TIP, as its main use case
    was addressed when [TIP 215](215.md) was accepted, and the measured
    consensus was that the proposed extra command offered too little over
    that. By comparison, **array value** is more useful and parallels [TIP
    342](342.md) in terms of general high-level capabilities (though there are
    syntactic differences).
