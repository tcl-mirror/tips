# Abstract

This TIP proposes to purge the usage of the Master/Slave paradigm from Tcl. This
is a gradual process. Just to be clear: Tk is out of scope for this TIP.


# Rationale

A discussion is currently going on about the Master/Slave and Blacklist/Whitelist
paradigm: Linux, Github and a lot more decided not to use this terms any
more. The TCT as a whole has no opinion on this (although individual member
will - sure - have an opinion). Since Tcl is a language for everyone, we
should not make life difficult for people being enforced to comply with
whatever rules. Since there is very little impact on Tcl, let's bend a little bit.

# Specification

In tclDecls.h, the following `#define`'s are added:
<pre>
\#define Tcl_CreateChild Tcl_CreateSlave
\#define Tcl_GetChild Tcl_GetSlave
\#define Tcl_GetParent Tcl_GetMaster
</pre>
In tclIntDecls.h, the following `#define` is added:
<pre>
\#define TclSetChildCancelFlags TclSetSlaveCancelFlags
</pre>

Further on, the "interp" command will get an additional
subcommand "children", which is synonym for "slaves".

That's it! This will allow extension/application writers
to comply with external limitations when they want to or
are forced to do so.

The "interp slaves" command will not be deprecated, not
even in Tcl 9.0. Neither will the usage of `Tcl_CreateSlave`
and friends be deprecated: Extension/application writers
are not forced to make the change, but they will be able
to.

In Tcl 8.7, the documentation and header files will be
changed to comply with this renaming. The above `#define`'s will
be reversed, so the functions will continue to be available under
the old name too.
