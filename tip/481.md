# Abstract

This TIP proposes enhancing various C API functions which having a `int *` parameter,
to be used with a `size_t *` parameter as well.

# Rationale

In Tcl 9, the range of various functions need to be increased. For example
`Tcl_GetStringFromObj()` is currently limited to returning 31 bit for the
maximum string length. This can be fixed by introducing a new internal
function which has a `size_t *` parameter in stead of `int *`.
On top of that, `Tcl_GetStringFromObj()` is provided as a macro, which switches
between the two possible functions depending on the size of the parameter.

The same is done for `Tcl_GetUnicodeFromObj()` and `Tcl_GetByteArrayFromObj()`.

This way, we have a compatibility layer, easing the transition to Tcl 9.
In Tcl 8.7, although the parameter has type size\_t, the length range
that can be returned is actually only 0 up to 4294967294. In Tcl 9, the full
size\_t range is available.

Commits like [this one](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tk/info/1597671a5e01ad99) (in Tk)
will no longer be needed; the function `TkGetStringFromObj()` will just become
obsolete: `Tcl_GetStringFromObj()` will be useable no matter the string length
being stored in an `int` or a 'size_t' variable.

# Specification

Add to Tcl's stub table of public C routines the following new (internal) routines

 > int **TclGetStringFromObj**\(Tcl\_Obj \*_objPtr_, size\_t \*_lengthPtr_\)

 > int **TclGetUnicodeFromObj**\(Tcl\_Obj \*_objPtr_, size\_t \*_lengthPtr_\)

 > int **TclGetByteArrayFromObj**\(Tcl\_Obj \*_objPtr_, size\_t \*_lengthPtr_\)

Those 3 functions do exactly the same as their existing counterparts, only the _lengthPtr_
parameter is of type `size_t` in stead of `int`. The original 3 functions will be wrapped in
a macro of the same name, so depending on the actual size of the variable where _lengthPtr_
points to, the switch between the two function versions are done automatically. Therefore, the
new functions are not supposed to be used directly in code, usage is fully transparent
through the Tcl\_GetStringFromObj/Tcl\_GetUnicodeFromObj/Tcl\_GetByteArrayFromObj macros.

# Implementation
