# Abstract

This TIP proposes enhancing various C API functions which now have `int *` parameter,
to be used as if they have a `size_t *` parameter. In addition, a new `Tcl_GetValue()`
function is proposed which can retrieve a signed or unsigned integer from a `Tcl_Obj`,
or a float/double/long double.

# Rationale

In Tcl 9, the range of various functions need to be increased. For example
`Tcl_GetStringFromObj` now is limited to returning 32 bit for the maximum
string length. This can be fixed by introducing an internal function
`Tcl_GetStringFromObj2()` which has a `size_t *` parameter in stead of `int *`.
`Tcl_GetStringFromObj` will be converted to a macro, which switches
 between the two possible functions depending on the size of the parameter.

This way, we have a compatibility layer, easing the transition to Tcl 9.
Extensions can already start using the extended range, even though it
actually doesn't have effect in Tcl 8 yet.

# Specification

TODO

# Implementation
