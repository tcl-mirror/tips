# Abstract

This TIP describes the non-controversial part of the Tcl 9 changes: Make Tcl 9 ready for the 64-bit era.

# Rationale

Many Tcl API functions and struct fields have _int_ parameters, which don't provide sufficient room on 64-bit platforms.

# Proposal

  * Enhance the hash functions, such that the hash value is stored in a size\_t in stead of unsigned int. This allows hash tables to grow beyond 4Gb on 64-bit platforms

  * Enhance all struct fields representing refCounts or epochs, make them of type size_t

  * All memory-related functions, such as Tcl\_Alloc\(\), will change its size argument from _int_ to _size\_t_, and its "char *" arguments to "void *"
  
  * Many functions, which have size parameters of type _int_ (but NOT _int_ *) will change to type size\_t

  * On 32-bit platforms, this is all 100% upwards binary compatible, provided no _internal_ API is used (since some internal structs has incompatible but externally invisible changes)

  * On 64-bit platforms, those changes cause binary incompatibility, but source compatibility is retained. Therefore the TCL_MAGIC value needs to change, so extensions compiled using Tcl 9 headers will not load in Tcl 8 and reverse.

TODO explain changes in more detail.
