# Abstract

This TIP proposes the addition of an **is dict** test to the **string** ensemble. The command
will return true if the value is a valid dict, and false otherwise.

# Rationale

Currently the means to test of a string is a leaf node is to check if the string
is a list and it's length is divisible by 2. The problem is that this requires 2
different calls from the interpreter, and generates a dict to list conversion for
the most common case (namely that the value is, indeed, a dict.)

This TIP proposes a shortcut in C to check to see if the internal representation is
already a dict, and provide a shortcut for the most common case.

# Implementation

A new branch has been added to the tcl fossil system [tip-501](https://core.tcl.tk/tcl/timeline?r=tip-501)

The crux of the implementation is adding "dict" to the IS ensemble:

    case STR_IS_DICT:
	/*
	 * We ignore the strictness here, since empty strings are always
	 * well-formed lists.
	 */
    int dresult, dsize;
	dresult = Tcl_DictObjSize(NULL, objPtr, &dsize);
	result = (dresult==TCL_OK) ? 1 : 0;
	break;
