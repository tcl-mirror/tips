~ Abstract

Tcl should provide a mechanism by which a channel's output buffer can be
released without requiring that Tcl flush any remaining data in the buffer to
the operating system. This is of particular interest with output mechanisms
which can block indefinitely causing the interpreter to consume unnecessary
resources or prevent the interpreter from exiting.
