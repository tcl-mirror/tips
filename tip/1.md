# Abstract

This TIP contains the index of all TIPs published over the lifetime of
the TCT. It will be continually and automatically updated.

# Index

\#index:

White backgrounds indicate that the TIP is still a draft, yellow
backgrounds highlight TIPs being voted on, and where a TIP has been
rejected, withdrawn or obsoleted its index entry has a dark grey
background.  Blue backgrounds indicate a TIP has been accepted,
but still needs an implementation approved by maintainers.  Green
backgrounds indicate that the TIP is deferred, waiting for someone
to work on it.

# Explanations and How To Submit New TIPs

See [[2]](2.md) for a description of the editorial process a TIP has to go
through and [[3]](3.md) for a description of their structure and the commands
used to write them. You submit a TIP to this archive by emailing it
\(preferably in source form\) to the TIP editor <donal.fellows@man.ac.uk>
who will check it for following of the guidelines, style and general
relevance to Tcl/Tk before checking it into the CVS archive and notifying
the author, the rest of the Tcl Core Team, and the relevant newsgroups.
