# Abstract

The Scan/Printf format handlers are originally derived from the
C-equivalent scan() and printf() functions. Since ISO C99 there is
the inttypes.h header file, which defines useful macros. But since
the Tcl implementation was older than that, those macros don't
play well together with Tcl. This TIP proposes a solution for that.

In addition, this TIP proposes to adapt the %#o modifier such that
it produces the "0o" prefix in stead of "o". This is a small step in the
direction of phasing out octal (TIP #114). Finally this TIP modifiers
the %#d modifier, such that it only produces a "0d" prefix if that
is needed for correct interpretation of the number when parsing it.

# Rationale

TODO


# Specification

This TIP proposes serveral things:

   *   Whenever possible, typedef Tcl_WideInt to be equal to long long, even
       on platforms where long has the same size as long long.

   *   Document the already existing TCL\_LL\_MODIFIER macro to be equivalent
       to "ll" whenever possible. This can be used to format/scan variables
       of type Tcl\_WideInt/Tcl\_WideUInt.

   *   Add a new TCL\_Z\_MODIFIER macro to be equivalent to "z" whenever possible.
       This can be used to format/scan variables of type size_t.

   *   Adapt the %#o modifier (TODO: explain)

   *   Adapt the %#d modifier (TODO: explain)

# Considerations regarding the incompatibility

This change is fully upwards compatible. As long as Tcl extensions use the
Tcl\_WideInt/Tcl\_WideUInt data types (in stead of long long or \_\_int64),
everything works as before.
