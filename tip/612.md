# Abstract

This TIP proposes a command to allowing setting of a toplevel's class
(especially the main window) after the creation of the window.

# Rationale

Currently there seems to be no way to set the application class of the
`WM_CLASS` property after the creation of the window. (It is possible to set
the application name using `tk appname <appname>`.) It should be possible to
update the application class, e.g. with a command like
`tk classname <classname>`.

# Proposal

This TIP proposes making the `-class` property of toplevels (and frames,
because of shared code) be settable (with the `configure` method) after the
widget is created. Note that doing this will not change the value of any
options that have already been looked up (though it will affect _future_ calls
to `option get`), nor will it change the `bindtags` of the widget.

Note that setting the class of toplevels is currently possible at widget
creation time. For the main application window, this means passing the
`-class` option in the arguments processed by `wish` or during
`package require Tk`.
