# Abstract

[Rbc][] aka "Refactored [BLT][] Components" have graph widgets and Tk commands which are missing in *Tk*.

[Tkpath][] is a 2D-canvas like widget modelled after [SVG][].

This TIP intends to add the following commands to Tk:

**rbc::graph**, **rbc::stripchart** and **rbc::barchart** as **graph**

> To get the original functionality a *-style* option will be added. This
option can only be set on creation time.

**rbc::vector** as **graph::vector**

> The vector is currently only used inside the graph widget. The namespace hidden version leaves room for a first class command with the same name.

**rbc::winop snap** as **tk snap**

> Only the snap functionality is needed here. The busy command already exists as "tk busy" :)

**tkp::canvas** as **path**

> The new path widget will contain the [SVG][] like items and an additional **window** item to include other windows. Support functions will be placed in the **::path** namespace.

New oo::class like widgets **tko::frame**, **tko::labelframe** and **tko::toplevel**

> The new widgets will contain the same functionalite like the original *tk* widgets. They are *oo:class*'s and it is possible to add,change and delte methods and options dynamically. The widgets could also be used as oo *superclass*'s.

New **tko::widget** oo base class for widgets.

> The class provide the extended cget/configure tcl methods (see [`tkoWidget.n.md`](https://core.tcl.tk/tk/doc/tip-510/doc/tkoWidget.n.md)) and a C interface (see [`tkoWidget.3.md`](https://core.tcl.tk/tk/doc/tip-510/doc/tkoWidget.3.md)) to build new widgets.

# Rationale

## Rbc commands

*Tk* has already adopted some of [BLT][]/[Rbc][] commands.
Still missing are the above mentioned commands.

[Rbc][] is available on sourceforge and github, but the development is stalled.

[BLT][], the orignal source, is at sourceforge. The author G. Howlett makes sporadic changes. Then there are large times without activity. It is not possible to estimate when a new version will be ready.

Modernizing [Rbc][] and including it in *Tk* will give some great new widgets.
There is also less risk because [Rbc][] is already used in different projects.

## Tkpath

The original developer of [Tkpath][] passed away. There are some mirrors, but with no real development. More information could be found on <https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/tkpath>.

The intent of [Tkpath][] was to substitute the *Tk* canvas. This leads to problems with advanced features (matrix transformations). Therefore the new **path** widget will only contain [SVG][] like items. The only exception is the **window** item. This item is necessary to embed other widgets.

## oo::class like widgets

Currently there is no megawidget support core package. These tip will go some steps in this direction. With widgets as **oo::class**'s we can easyly extent existing widgets, just use it as a superclass. The provided cget/configure methods allow add, delete and changing of options. The implementation can be used in C and in Tcl.

The new widgets **graph** and **path** are also implemented as **oo::class**. This will make it easy to extent the functionality. As an example see the file `.../library/graph.tcl` in which the method **binding** of the **graph** widget is implemented.

# Implementation

A patch implementing these changes is available in the fossil
repository in the [tip-510 branch](https://core.tcl.tk/tk/timeline?r=tip-510).

## C interface

C-source interface files are in `.../generic/tko/`.  No functionality is currently exported.

- [`tkoWidget.h`](https://core.tcl.tk/tk/doc/tip-510/generic/tko/tkoWidget.h) **tko::widget** C functions and definitions.
- [`tkoPath.h`](https://core.tcl.tk/tk/doc/tip-510/generic/tko/tkoPath.h) **path** widget
- [`tkoGraph.h`](https://core.tcl.tk/tk/doc/tip-510/generic/tko/tkoGraph.h) **graph** widget

## C sources

C-source code files are in `.../generic/tko/`. The new files are  added to the makefiles. The calls to the initialization functions are added in tkWindow.c

- [`tkoFrame.c`](https://core.tcl.tk/tk/doc/tip-510/generic/tko/tkoFrame.c) **tko::frame**, **tko::labelframe** and **tko::toplevel** implementation
- `tkoGraph*.[ch]` **graph** widget implementation
- `tkoVector*.[ch]` **graph::vector** command implementation
- `tkoRbc*.[ch]` Additional [Rbc][] commands used in **graph** and **graph::vector**
- `tkoGraph*.[ch]` **path** widget implementation
- [`tkoWidget.c`](https://core.tcl.tk/tk/doc/tip-510/generic/tko/tkoWidget.c) **tko::widget** base class implementation

## Tcl sources

Tcl-source code is in `.../library/`. The new files are added into `tk.tcl`.

- [`graph.tcl`](https://core.tcl.tk/tk/doc/tip-510/library/graph.tcl) graph widget bindings
- [`path.tcl`](https://core.tcl.tk/tk/doc/tip-510/library/path.tcl) path widget helper function under **::path**

# Discussion

See also discussion at the [wiki](http://wiki.tcl.tk/55360).

A first voting was rejected, mostly because of the missing Mac implementation. See:

<http://code.activestate.com/lists/tcl-core/20357/>  
<http://code.activestate.com/lists/tcl-core/20368/>  

and with some analysis from Donal:

<http://code.activestate.com/lists/tcl-core/20384/>  

# Open issues

- Mac implementation of **graph** widget. May be borrow code from **path**
- Remove or change old code in `generic/tko/*` files <http://code.activestate.com/lists/tcl-core/20384/>
- Hardcoded usage of compiler and libraries in [`win/Makefile.in`](https://core.tcl.tk/tk/doc/tip-510/win/Makefile.in), [`win/makefile.vc`](https://core.tcl.tk/tk/doc/tip-510/win/makefile.vc) and [`unix/Makefile.in`](https://core.tcl.tk/tk/doc/tip-510/unix/Makefile.in) (search for "#RZ TODO").
- Add **path** files in Mac implementation. It works at least in [Androwish][].
- Which platforms should be used in **path**
  - SDL/AGG: platform independent, more work is needed using [`tkoPath_SDLAGG.cpp`](https://core.tcl.tk/tk/doc/tip-510/generic/tko/tkoPath_SDLAGG.cpp). See in [Androwish][]
  - GDI+ on Windows => working with [`tkoPath_WinGDIPlus.cpp`](https://core.tcl.tk/tk/doc/tip-510/generic/tko/tkoPath_WinGDIPlus.cpp)
  - Cairo on unix => working with [`tkoPath_UnixCairo.c`](https://core.tcl.tk/tk/doc/tip-510/generic/tko/tkoPath_UnixCairo.c)
  - For Mac see [`tkoPath_MacOSX.c`](https://core.tcl.tk/tk/doc/tip-510/generic/tko/tkoPath_MacOSX.c)
- Provide demos
- Add more **path** tests
- Is it necessary to translate the documentation into man format?
- It is currently not possible to use unique abbreviations of class method names p.e. "graph .g; .g conf" A workaround would be to add all those method names. May be this can be solved in tcl::oo directly?

Any help especially with the Mac implementation would be great!

And could please look someone with `configure` foo at the Makefile's

# Alternatives

- Wait on new [BLT][].
- Develop widgets in extensions.
