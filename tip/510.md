# Abstract

*Rbc* aka "Refactored BLT Components" provides some widgets which are missing in *Tk*.
This tip intend to add *Rbc* in the same way as *Ttk* to *Tk*.

# Rationale

*Tk* has already adopted some of *BLT/Rbc* commands.
Still missing are the widgets.

*Rbc* is available on sourceforge. But the development is stalled.

Modernizing *Rbc* and including it in *Tk* will give some great new widgets.
Using the same approach like in *Ttk* will give results in very short time.
There is also less risk because *Rbc* is already used in different projects.

# Specification

C-source code will be put in *.../generic/rbc/*
Tcl-source  code will be put in *.../library/rbc/*
Test files will be put in *.../tests/rbc/*

The *Rbc* files will be added to the makefiles.
The **Rbc__Init()** function will be added in tkWindow.c

# Discussion

Which commands should be included?
  **vector**: needed for graph
  **graph**: curve display widget
  **stripchart**: 
  **barchart**:
  **busy**: not needed, because we already have **tk busy**
  **winop**: ?

Should there be a special switch to enable compiling and including *Rbc*?

Should we change *Rbc* to some other name to prevent name clashes?

Should we export a C-interface?
