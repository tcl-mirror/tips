# Abstract

This TIP proposes to add the possibility to link Tcl with an external libtommath library, if available, for shared builds.

# Rationale

Since 8.6, Tcl has had a built-in libtommath library with modifications. By now, many of those modifications
were adopted upstream. This makes it possible to change the built Tcl library, using the external libtommath
library as-is, instead of using it's own fork. libtommath will continue to be delivered together with
the Tcl source code.

# Specification and Documentation

Starting with libtommath 1.1.0, it is possible to build Tcl without the internal libtommath, instead linking
with the unmodified, externally built, libtommath. This has the following consequences:

  * On 64-bit platforms (win64, linux-64), libtommath will now be built in 64-bit mode, while Tcl's libtommath used to be
    built in 32-bit mode.  Extensions which depend on the internal structure of the libtommath types will need
    to be re-compiled.

  * On win32/win64, a pre-built libtommath dll will be available, so libtommath will get the same status as
    zlib. Only when Tcl is build statically (`--disable-shared`) a (subset of) libtommath will still be built-in,
    the same subset that Tcl depends on.

  * One of Tcl's modifications (in mp\_sqrt) [doesn't work in 64-bit mode](https://travis-ci.org/tcltk/tcl/builds/512875496).
    In the implementation branch this modification is reverted. It can be put back as soon as the code is fixed for
    64-bit mode and accepted upstream.

  * Extensions can now choose whether they want to depend on libtommath directly or not. When using "`tclTomMath.h`",
    they will be linked to Tcl's libtommath stub table, when using "`tommath.h`" they will be linked directly
    to the external libtommath library. Both ways will continue to be supported. Extensions using "`tommath.h`"
    can use all available libtommath functions. When using "`tclTomMath.h`" only a subset is available.

  * "`tclTomMath.h`" is no longer part of "`tclInt.h`". So extension depending on "`tclInt.h`" but using libtommath
    functions will need to be adapted.

  * The types "mp\_digit" and "mp\_word" are no longer declared by `tcl.h`.  Extensions using those types will need
    to start using the "`tclTomMath.h`" or "`tommath.h`" includes as well.

# Implementation

All makefiles are adapted to detect external presence of libtommath 1.1.0 or later. If so, this library will be used
for shared builds, otherwise the built-in libtommath will continue to be used as before.

An implementation of this TIP is present in the [digit-bit-60](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tcl/timeline?r=digit-bit-60) branch.
