# Abstract

This TIP proposes to make public the routines that get and set the startup
script file that _Tcl\_Main_ or _Tk\_Main_ evaluate in their non-interactive
modes.

# Background

When support for the **-encoding** option was added to tclsh and wish [[137]](137.md),
two new internal routines were added to Tcl:

 > Tcl\_Obj \***Tcl\_GetStartupScript**\(const char \*\*_encodingNamePtr_\)

 > void **Tcl\_SetStartupScript**\(Tcl\_Obj \*_pathPtr_, const char
   *_encodingName_\)

These routines \(or other weaker alternative internal routines\) are used by
both wish and Tclkit by way of the internal stubs table to manipulate the
startup script for _Tcl\_Main_ or _Tk\_Main_ to evaluate.

# Rationale

The naming of these routines indicate they were always intended to be\(come\)
public.

These are the last "private" Tcl routines used by Tk and wish. After
implementation of this TIP, Tk can drop use of tclInt.h.

# Proposal

Make these routines public.

# Compatibility

There will need to be some care taken for existing users of these routines via
the private stubs table. The ability to compile against Tcl 8.6 headers, yet
run against a pre-8.6 stubs table will likely be lost.
