# Abstract

Currently only a limited set of types of C variable may be linked to
using Tcl\_LinkVar. This TIP proposes extending this to cover all the
basic numeric C types.

# Rationale

With the current implementation it is not possible to link the
following types directly to a Tcl variable, making it much more
difficult to couple such variables to the Tcl level \(compared with
**int** or **double** variables\). This TIP fixes this, making it
easier to link C variables and embedded Tcl code.

 * **char**

 * **unsigned char**

 * **short**

 * **unsigned short**

 * **unsigned int**

 * **long**

 * **unsigned long**

 * **Tcl\_WideUInt**

 * **float**

There will be no impact on current applications.

# Specification

The new types are inserted as new **\#define TCL\_LINK\_\*** statements
in the _tcl.h_ header file and in the **switch** statements in the
_Tcl\_Link_ functions.

The documentation of _Tcl\_\*Link\*_ should mention the new types.

# Reference Implementation

A reference implementation is available as Patch \#1242844 on
SourceForge<http://sf.net/support/tracker.php?aid=1242844> .
