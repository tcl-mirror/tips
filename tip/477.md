# <a id='toc-2'></a>Abstract

Tcl, Tk and extensions are currently built using one of two build
systems - the Tcl Extension Architecture (TEA) and the
Windows/Visual C++ specific nmake based environment. This TIP
addresses only the latter with a view to modernize it to remove
obsolete features, non-optimal build settings, and simplify writing
and maintenance of extensions.

This TIP also serves as the documentation of the reworked nmake build system.

# <a id='toc-3'></a>Background and Rationale

The current nmake-based build system is based on three files in the
`win` directory of a project.

* `makefile.vc` is the master makefile for the project

* `rules.mk` is included by makefile.vc and contains the common
nmake macro definitions and parsing of configuration options shared
by all projects.

* `nmakehlp.c` is a helper application that strives to overcome
the extremely primitive functionality of `nmake`. It is invoked from
rules.mk to check for supported compiler options, simple string
parsing etc.

As currently implemented, the system has several drawbacks including
duplication of code making maintenance difficult, unnecessarily
verbose extension makefiles, and inconsistent application of compiler
options.

## <a id='toc-4'></a>Avoiding duplication of code

In principle, `rules.mk` and `nmakehlp.c` should be shared across Tcl,
Tk and all extensions. In practice, each has its own copy leading to
divergence between the various copies and the resulting maintenance
headaches. Currently, in the 
author found every single extension, including Tk, had diverged from
Tcl. This means updates for new compilers, changes in Tcl build
configuration (e.g. -DUNICODE) do not make their way into extensions.
Moreover, making fixes involves individually fixing extensions, some
of which are orphaned.

The first goal is therefore to *allow each extension, including Tk,
to be built off Tcl's master copy (either installed or from source)
without having to maintain its own*.

## <a id='toc-5'></a>Simplifying extension makefiles

In addition, creating a `makefile.vc` for even a simple extension
involves a lot of unnecessary boilerplate leading to
copy-n-paste-itis and attendant problems. For the vast majority
of "standard" extensions, implicit rules, standard targets,
installation etc. should be automatically handled. Ideally, the
`makefile.vc` should specify only the project name and list of object
files. All else should be automatically taken care off.

Thus, a secondary goal is to *simplify the writing of extension
makefiles to a minimalist form that reduces the boilerplate to
extension-specific configuration*.

The following makefile should suffice to build DLL,
static and debug versions of an extension with standard targets
like `install`, `clean` etc. It will also automatically perform
ancillary tasks such as embedding a Windows version resource in
the generated binary without the extension writer having to
write a resource definition file.

>
	PROJECT=sample
	!include "rules-ext.vc"
	PRJ_OBJS = $(TMP_DIR)\sample.obj \
	               $(TMP_DIR)\util.obj
	!include "targets.vc"
	pkgindex: default-pkgindex

For more complex extensions, the build system should be incrementally
customizable using "building blocks".

## <a id='toc-6'></a>Auditing compiler configuration

There are some bugs, inconsistencies and misconfiguration of compiler
options in the various incarnations of the extension
makefiles. Examples include unoptimized release builds in some
important extensions like Tk and Sqlite, differing floating point
conformance options in debug and release builds even within Tcl and so
on.

Therefore, *a standard set of documented `nmake` macros are defined to
ensure consistency across build configurations*.

## <a id='toc-7'></a>Non-goals

It is not the intent of this TIP to look at alternatives to
nmake. There is already the TEA based system for those who prefer to
use it.

Certain limitations in the current nmake system, in particular
the requirement that there be no spaces in the source directories path
are not addressed.

# <a id='toc-8'></a>Command line interface

There will be no changes to the command line interface used to build
Tcl and extensions using nmake except for removal of some obsolete
features.

    nmake /f makefile.vc ?targets? ?macros? 

The targets are as always defined by the makefile. However, the system
also has standard predefined targets that makes it unnecessary for the
extension makefile to define targets in many common cases. These
are detailed later.

## <a id='toc-9'></a>Build configuration macros

The macros passed on the command line are for the most part the same
as in the current system. They specify the build configuration such as
whether an extension is built as a static or shared library,
instrumentation, generation of debug information and so on. The most
commonly useful macros and their possible values are listed below.
For a full list, see the comments in `rules.vc` file.

The `OPTS` macro controls the build configuration for the compiler and
linker. Its value is a comma-separated list of option values, the more
common options being listed in the table below.

>
Option | Effect
-------|-------
`none`|Nullifies other options even if they are specified.
`static` | Builds the module as a static library instead of the default shared library
`pdbs` | Generates PDB files with symbol information even for release builds
`symbols` | Builds a debug version (no optimization, debug C runtime, PDB's)
`staticpkg` | Specifies `registry` and `dde` extensions should be statically bound (`tclsh` and `wish` only)

The `STATS` macro, also specified as a comma-separated list,
controls generation of instrumentation code as shown
below. This is relevant only for building Tcl itself, not extensions.

>
Option|Effect
------|------
`none`|Turns off all instrumentation irrespective of other options being specified.
`memdbg`|Enables instrumentation of memory allocation.
`compdbg`|Enables byte compiler logging for debugging purposes.

The `CHECKS` macro configure additional compiler checks and warnings.

>
Option|Effect
------|------
`none`|Turns off other `CHECKS` options even if specified.
`nodep`|Disables support for deprecated functions.
`fullwarn`|Cranks up the compiler warnings level.
`64bit`|Enables 64-bit portability warnings.

The following command will generate a static library with PDB debug
information, memory instrumentation, full warnings and disabling
of deprecated functions.

>
    nmake /f makefile.vc OPTS=static,pdbs STATS=memdbg CHECKS=nodep,fullwarn

# <a id='toc-10'></a>Basic makefiles

## <a id='toc-11'></a>Makefile for a basic Tcl extension

**NOTE:** By convention, makefiles using the nmake system are named
`makefile.vc`. Here we refer to them simply as makefile.

In the simplest case, a Tcl extension follows the common convention
where sources are stored in the subdirectories `generic`, `win` and `compat`
(not necessarily all). For such an extension, the following serves
as a complete makefile.

>
	PROJECT=sample
	!include "rules-ext.vc"
	PRJ_OBJS = $(TMP_DIR)\sample.obj \
	               $(TMP_DIR)\util.obj \
	!endif
	!include "targets.vc"
	pkgindex: default-pkgindex

The lines must be in the order shown with `PROJECT` defined before
inclusion of `rules-ext.vc` and `PRJ_OBJS` after. The standard
targets, defined in `targets.vc`, are included last.

Given the above, the commands

>
	nmake /f makefile.vc INSTALLDIR=/path/to/tcl
	nmake /f makefile.vc INSTALLDIR=/path/to/tcl OPTS=static
	nmake /f makefile.vc INSTALLDIR=/path/to/tcl OPTS=debug
	nmake /f makefile.vc INSTALLDIR=/path/to/tcl OPTS=static,debug

will 

* build shared, static and debug versions of the
extension depending on the specified `OPTS` macro

* create an appropriate `pkgIndex.tcl` file

* generate and embed Windows version resource in the binaries.

Note the extension author need not write `pkgIndex.tcl`
or Windows resource definition file unless there is some custom need.

In addition, standard targets for installation
and clean up are also included so for example

>
    nmake /f makefile.vc INSTALLDIR=/path/to/tcl install
    
will install the extension while 

>
    nmake /f makefile.vc INSTALLDIR=/path/to/tcl clean
    nmake /f makefile.vc INSTALLDIR=/path/to/tcl realclean

will do various levels of cleaning.

The two macros that need to be defined for a basic extension are shown below.

>
Macro|Description
-----|-----------
`PROJECT`|Name of the package. Must be defined before including `rules-ext.vc`.
`PRJ_OBJS`|List of object and resource files for building the extension. The object files must be prefixed with `$(TMP_DIR)\` exactly as shown above.

## <a id='toc-12'></a>Makefile for a basic Tk extension

In case of a Tk extension, the only change required is to set
the `PROJECT_REQUIRES_TK` macro to `1` before including `rules-ext.vc`.

>
	PROJECT=sample
	PROJECT_REQUIRES_TK = 1
	!include "rules-ext.vc"
	PRJ_OBJS = $(TMP_DIR)\sample.obj \
	               $(TMP_DIR)\util.obj \
	!endif
	!include "targets.vc"
	pkgindex: default-pkgindex

All else remains the same as for a Tcl extension.

# <a id='toc-13'></a>The nmake build environment

The `nmake` build environment described above is implemented through 
four files `rules-ext.vc`, `rules.vc`, `targets.vc` and 
`nmakehlp.c`. The role of each is described in this section.

## <a id='toc-14'></a>The `rules-ext.vc` file

The `rules-ext.vc` file is intended to be included by the extension's
makefile to locate and load the latest compatible `rules.vc` file.  It
checks if the installed Tcl has copies of `rules.vc` and `nmakehlp.c`
that are newer versions than the ones in the extension sources, and if
so uses them instead of the extension's copies. In the case of
extensions that build against the Tcl source (as opposed to a Tcl
installation), it checks the versions in the Tcl source directory in a
similar manner.

The compilation rules are versioned via the `RULES_VERSION_MAJOR` and
`RULES_VERSION_MINOR` macros defined in `rules.vc`. 
Versioning is similar to Tcl's in how major and minor versions are
treated. When comparing versions, the files in the Tcl installation
are used if they have the same major version as that in the
extension's rules file and their minor version is the equal or greater. 

## <a id='toc-15'></a>The `nmakehlp.c` program
The `nmakehlp.c` program has the same purpose and functionality as in
the current system. It is unchanged and not detailed here. It is 
compiled and invoked on the fly from nmake for some utility purposes
such as extracting versions, searching for strings etc.

## <a id='toc-16'></a>The `rules.vc` file

This is the heart of the current nmake system and remains so, with
enhancements to include as much of project-independent functionality
as possible. The file is responsible for

* Determining the compiler environment including target architecture,
supported compiler switches etc.

* Parsing any options and macros supplied by the user on the command
line

* Extracting version numbers, include paths etc.

* Defining compiler and linker switches, output paths, and standard
targets based on the above.

It is intended that there will be only one "master" `rules.vc` file,
the one in the Tcl repository where all changes are made. Extensions
will have unmodified copies of this if they need to be build against
older versions of Tcl. Otherwise, they will use the one installed with
Tcl or from the Tcl sources if building against the latter.

## <a id='toc-17'></a>The `targets.vc` file

This file, *optionally* included by the extension's master makefile,
defines some standard targets that relieves the extension from having
to define its own. It is separated from `rules.vc` so as to permit
master makefile to modify macros set by `rules.vc` before they
are expanded in the target rules.

Inclusion of this file is optional in the sense that more complex
makefiles may choose to define their own standard targets.

## <a id='toc-18'></a>Distributing the nmake build system

To eliminate the issue of divergence between the nmake support files
as well as the need for continual maintenance and update, the files
`rules.vc`, `nmakehlp.c` and `targets.vc` will be installed as part
of a Tcl install in a similar fashion to `tclconfig.sh`,
`tclstub86.lib` etc. except that they will be placed in the
`lib\nmake` subdirectory under the Tcl installation's root directory.

These files will also be copied to each extension's source repository
as is (supposed to be) done today. *However, this is only a one-time
copy and unlike the current system, it is not required to be done
every time Tcl's version of these files change.* This also allows the
extension to be built against older versions of Tcl that do not
include these files in their installation.

# <a id='toc-19'></a>Locating Tcl and Tk

Building an extension requires Tcl, and optionally Tk, header files
and libraries. The nmake build system locates directories in the
following order:

The installation directory is specified via the `INSTALLDIR` macro on
the command line. If unspecified, this defaults to `C:\Tcl`.
**NOTE**: this is a change from the current default of
`C:\Program Files\Tcl` because the latter may not have access
permissions for the user.

The location of the Tcl header files and libraries is specified
with the `TCLDIR` macro.

* If the macro `TCLDIR` is defined on the command line, it is used as
  the location of the Tcl root directory. This is generally the
  directory containing an installed Tcl but could also point to the
  root of a Tcl source tree if the extension requires Tcl internal
  headers (not recommended).

* If `TCLDIR` is not defined, the macro `INSTALLDIR` is treated as the
  Tcl root directory **if** the directory exists and contains the expected
  header files.

* As a last resort, the directory `../../tcl` is checked and if
  containing the expected header files, used as the value of `TCLDIR`.

* If the header files still cannot be located, an error is generated.

The macros `_INSTALLDIR` and `_TCLDIR` are generated from `INSTALLDIR`
and `TCLDIR` respectively and contain the native form of the path
(using backslashes as directory separators).

In the case of extensions, the macro `TCLINSTALL` is set to `1` if the
extension is being built against an installed Tcl and `0` if it is
built against Tcl sources. For Tk extensions, the macro `TKINSTALL` is
set similarly depending on whether the extension is being built
against an installed Tk or against Tk sources.

# <a id='toc-20'></a>Customizing and extending the build environment

It is hoped that the basic makefile structure described earlier will
suffice for the majority of extensions which follow standard conventions
of source directory location etc. However, extensions may diverge from
convention for several reasons.

* The source subdirectories may not be named `generic`, `compat` etc.

* Additional options, include paths, libraries etc. may need to be
  passed to the compiler and / or linker

* The makefile may build multiple extensions and programs. The author
does not recommend this as it has few advantages over independent
makefiles.

* It may need customized `pkgIndex.tcl` or Windows version resources.

* It may provide its own stubs interface.

* The installation may need added functionality such as installation
of documentation, demo applications etc.

* And so on.

These all require different levels of customization and extension and
the nmake system tries to accomodate these with minimal effort as
described in the following sections.

## <a id='toc-21'></a>Location of extension sources and implicit rules

The basic makefile shown earlier assumes the following directory
structure for the extension sources:

>
Subdirectory|Macro|Description
---|---|---
`generic`|`GENERICDIR`|Directory containing platform-neutral source files.
`win`|`WINDIR`|Directory containing Windows specific source files.
`compat`|`COMPATDIR`|Directory with additional source files implementing functions not present on all platforms.
`doc`|`DOCDIR`|Directory containing documentation files.
`demos`|`DEMODIR`|Directory containing any demo files.
`tools`|`TOOLSDIR`|Directory containing any build tools.

Only the `GENERICDIR`, `WINDIR` and `COMPATDIR` macros are used by
`rules.vc` file and intialized to the above paths if not already
defined by the parent makefile. Implicit rules are defined to generate
the object files corresponding to sources in any of these
directories. If the source directories are named differently, the
corresponding macro can be defined appropriately **before** including
`rules-ext.vc`.

So for example, if your generic sources were in directory `src`, the
makefile would be modified as

>
	PROJECT = sample
	GENERICDIR = ..\src
	!include "rules-ext.vc"
    ...rest remains same...

In case there are additional directories containing sources, you will
have to define an additional implicit rule for each such
directory. For example, if the directory `extrasrc` contained the
additional sources, you would add the lines below after including
`rules-ext.vc`.

>
    EXTRADIR = $(ROOT)\extrasrc

    {$(EXTRADIR)}.c{$(TMP_DIR)}.obj::
	        $(cc32) $(pkgcflags) -Fo$(TMP_DIR)\ @<<
    $<
    <<

Here `cc32` and `pkgcflags` are standard macros defined within
`rules.vc`. These are described later.

The `DOCDIR`, `DEMODIR` and `TOOLSDIR` macros are only defined
as conveniences for the parent makefile.

## <a id='toc-22'></a>Output directories and file names

Based on the options specified on the command line, compiler version
and target architecture, the following macros are defined:

Macro|Description
-----|-----------
`OUT_DIR`|Directory to place output executables and libraries
`TMP_DIR`|Directory to place all the object files

The output directory path placed in `OUT_DIR` has the form
`Release_COMPILERVERSION` for x86 builds and
`Release_AMD64_COMPILERVERSION` for x64 builds (the discrepancy
in inclusion of architecture is historical).

The object files directory path placed in `TMP_DIR` has the form


## <a id='toc-23'></a>Implicit rules

TBD

## <a id='toc-24'></a>Compiler and link flags

TBD

## <a id='toc-25'></a>Windows resource files

Windows programs and DLL's are expected to have a version resource 
embedded in them though this is not mandatory. To free the extension
author from having to write a resource definition file, the nmake
build system will automatically generate one and embed it into the
built DLL extension.

If the standard template is not adequate for whatever reason, a custom
resource definition file may be specified by defining the `RCFILE`
macro **before** including `rules-ext.vc` in the extension makefile.

>
    RCFILE = custom.rc

By default, the nmake system will look in the `win` and `win\rc`
directories for this file. If located elsewhere, define the `RCDIR`
as the path to the directory where the file is located. Again,
this must be defined before inclusion of `rules-ext.vc`. For example,

>
    ...
    RCDIR = $(ROOT)\rc
	!include "rules-ext.vc"
    ...

(`ROOT` is automatically defined as the root of the extension source
tree.)

All of the above will make use of implicit rules defined in
`rules.vc`. If more control is desired, for example to pass
additional flags to the resource compiler, an explicit rule needs
to be added to the extension makefile **after** including
`rules-ext.vc`. For example,

>
    $(TMP_DIR)\custom.res: $(RCDIR)\custom.rc
	    $(MAKERESCMD) /DCUSTOMFLAG=1 $<
		
Note the use of `TMP_DIR` and `RCDIR` in the dependency. The 
`MAKERESCMD` macro defines the command and associated standard flags to 
compile a resource definition file.

## <a id='toc-26'></a>Generating pkgIndex.tcl

The standard default `install` target expects a `pkgIndex.tcl` file to have
been generated and placed in the `$(OUT_DIR)` output directory. It
then copies this into the extension's installation directory as part
of the install. To generate this file, the top level target that
builds the project has a dependency on the `pkgindex` target which
is responsible for generating this file.

For a pure binary extension (without any additional Tcl script files), the
following line added after including `targets.vc`

>
    pkgindex: default-pkgindex
	
will generate this file with no additional work required on the
author's part.

Alternately, if there is a `pkgIndex.tcl.in` file in the extension
root directory that is used with the TEA build environment, the
`default-pkgindex-tea` target can be used instead.

>
    pkgindex: default-pkgindex-tea
	
In this case, the `pkgIndex.tcl` is generated from `pkgIndex.tcl.in`
by replacing all occurences of `@PACKAGE_VERSION@`, `@PACKAGE_NAME@`
and `@PKG_LIB_FILE@` with the values of macros `$(DOTVERSION)`,
`$(PROJECT)` and `$(PRJLIBNAME)` respectively.

For all other cases, the extension author needs to write their own
target commands for `pkgindex` that results in a `pkgIndex.tcl` file
being placed in the `$(OUT_DIR)` directory.

## <a id='toc-27'></a>Targets

### <a id='toc-28'></a>Predefined targets

Since most extensions build commands in a similar fashion, the
`rules.vc` file provides some predefined targets that encapsulate the
requisite commands. These are shown in the table below.

>
Target|Description
------|-----------
`default-pkgindex`|Generates a `pkgIndex.tcl` file for a pure binary extension in the output directory.
`default-pkgindex-tea`|Generates a `pkgIndex.tcl` file in the output directory using a TEA `pkgIndex.tcl.in` file as a template.
`default-install`|Combines `default-install-binaries` and `default-install-libraries`.
`default-install-binaries`|Copies the generated binary extension to the installation directory.
`default-install-libraries`|Copies all `*.tcl` files from `$(LIBDIR)`, if it exists, to the installation directory.
`default-clean`|Cleans up `$(TMP_DIR)` but not `$(OUT_DIR)`
`default-hose`|Cleans up `$(OUT_DIR)` which normally also includes `$(TMP_DIR)`
`default-distclean`|Maps to `default-hose` plus cleans up `nmakehlp` helpers.
`default-setup`|Does common build initialization like creation of output directories.


### <a id='toc-29'></a>The default target

If unspecified on the command line, the default target is assumed to be 
`$(PROJECT)`. To change this, define the macro `DEFAULT_BUILD_TARGET`
before including `rules-ext.vc`. For example,

>
    DEFAULT_BUILD_TARGET = release
	
Note you have to define the target yourself unless it is predefined or 
standard.

### <a id='toc-30'></a>Standard targets

Inclusion of the file `targets.vc` defines "standard" targets commonly
defined in makefiles and shown in the table below. These generally
map to the predefined targets described earlier but can be extended as
discussed in the next section.

>
Target|Description
------|-----------
`install`|Maps to `default-install`.
`clean`|Maps to `default-clean`.
`hose`|Maps to `default-hose`.
`realclean`|Same as `hose`.
`distclean`|Maps to `default-distclean`.


### <a id='toc-31'></a>Extending targets

In some cases, the standard targets "almost" suffice but are missing
some additional actions. In such cases, instead of not including the
`targets.vc` file and defining your standard targets, you can extend
the standard targets by adding dependencies. For example,
the default rules do not generate and install
documentation as Tcl extensions do not have a common format and
structure for the same. In simple cases like this, the appropriate
target can be extended with additional commands:

>
    install: install-docs
    install-docs:
	    $(CPY) $(DOCDIR)\*.html "$(DOC_INSTALL_DIR)"

Note `CPY`, `DOCDIR` and `DOC_INSTALL_DIR` are all predefined or
computed macros within rules.vc.

### <a id='toc-32'></a>Ignoring standard targets

In the extreme case, the standard targets can be completely ignored
by the extension makefile by not including `targets.vc`. Note the
built-in targets can still be accessed as `default-install` etc. as
these are defined within `rules.vc`, not `targets.vc`. This is useful
if for example, you wish to override the targets for building but
use the default cleanup. In such a case, instead of including
`targets.vc` the following targets can be defined in the extension
makefile.

>
    $(PRJLIB):
	    ...Your custom build command to build the extension...
    install: default-install
    clean: default-clean
	hose: default-hose

As an aside, when defining your own commands for building targets, you
are strongly encouraged to make use of the predefined compiler 
and linker flags such as `$(pkgcflags)` etc. described elsewhere.
