# Abstract

Tcl, Tk and extensions are currently built using one of two build
systems - the Tcl Extension Architecture (TEA) and the
Windows/Visual C++ specific nmake based environment. This TIP
addresses only the latter with a view to modernize it to remove
obsolete features, non-optimal build settings, and simplify writing
and maintenance of extensions.

This TIP is not only a proposal, but is also intended as documentation
of the reworked nmake build system.

# Background and Rationale

The current nmake-based build system is based on three files in the
`win` directory of a project.

* `makefile.vc` is the master makefile for the project

* `rules.mk` is included by makefile.vc and contains the common
nmake macro definitions and parsing of configuration options shared
by all projects.

* `nmakehlp.c` is a helper application that strives to overcome
the extremely primitive functionality of `nmake`. It is invoked from
rules.mk to check for supported compiler options, simple string
parsing etc.

As currently implemented, the system has several drawbacks including
duplication of code making maintenance difficult, unnecessarily
verbose extension makefiles, and inconsistent application of compiler
options.

## Avoiding duplication of code

In principle, `rules.mk` and `nmakehlp.c` should be shared across Tcl,
Tk and all extensions. In practice, each has its own copy leading to
divergence between the various copies and the resulting maintenance
headaches. Currently, in the 
author found every single extension, including Tk, had diverged from
Tcl. This means updates for new compilers, changes in Tcl build
configuration (e.g. -DUNICODE) do not make their way into extensions.
Moreover, making fixes involves individually fixing extensions, some
of which are orphaned.

The first goal is therefore to *allow each extension, including Tk,
to be built off Tcl's master copy (either installed or from source)
without having to maintain its own*.

## Simplifying extension makefiles

In addition, creating a `makefile.vc` for even a simple extension
involves a lot of unnecessary boilerplate leading to
copy-n-paste-itis and attendant problems. For the vast majority
of "standard" extensions, implicit rules, standard targets,
installation etc. should be automatically handled. Ideally, the
`makefile.vc` should specify only the project name and list of object
files. All else should be automatically taken care off.

Thus, a secondary goal is to *simplify the writing of extension
makefiles to a minimalist form that reduces the boilerplate to
extension-specific configuration*.

## Auditing compiler configuration

There are some bugs, inconsistencies and misconfiguration of compiler
options in the various incarnations of the extension
makefiles. Examples include unoptimized release builds in some
important extensions like Tk and Sqlite, differing floating point
conformance options in debug and release builds even within Tcl and so
on.

Therefore, *a standard set of documented `nmake` macros are needed to
ensure consistency across build configurations*.

## Non-goals

It is not the intent of this TIP to look at alternatives to
nmake. There is already the TEA based system for those who prefer to
use it.

Certain limitations in the current nmake system, in particular
the requirement that there be no spaces in the source directories path
are not addressed.

# Command line interface

There will be no changes to the command line interface used to build
Tcl and extensions using nmake except for removal of some obsolete
features.

    nmake /f makefile.vc ?targets? ?macros? 

The predefined targets and macros are detailed later.

# Specification

## Distributing the nmake build system

To eliminate the issue of divergence between the nmake support files
as well as the need for continual maintenance and update, the files
`rules.vc`, `nmakehlp.c` and `targets.vc` will be installed as part
of a Tcl install in a similar fashion to `tclconfig.sh`,
`tclstub86.lib` etc.  except that they will be placed in the
`lib\nmake` subdirectory under the Tcl installation's root directory.

These files will also be copied to each extension's source repository
as is (supposed to be) done today. *However, this is only a one-time
copy and unlike the current system, it is not required to be done
every time Tcl's version of these files change.* This also allows the
extension to be built against older versions of Tcl that do not
include these files in their installation.

## The `rules-ext.vc` file

The `rules.vc` file is intended to be included by the extension's
makefile to locate and load the latest compatible `rules.vc` file.  It
checks if the installed Tcl has copies of `rules.vc` and `nmakehlp.c`
that are newer versions than the ones in the extension sources, and if
so uses them instead of the extension's copies. In the case of
extensions that build against the Tcl source (as opposed to a Tcl
installation), it checks the versions in the Tcl source directory in a
similar manner.

The compilation rules are versioned via the `RULES_VERSION_MAJOR` and
`RULES_VERSION_MINOR` macros defined in `rules.vc`. 
Versioning is similar to Tcl's in how major and minor versions are
treated. When comparing versions, the files in the Tcl installation
are used if they have the same major version as that in the
extension's rules file and their minor version is the equal or greater. 

## The `nmakehlp.c` program
The `nmakehlp.c` program has the same purpose and functionality as in
the current system. It is unchanged and not detailed here. It is 
compiled and invoked on the fly from nmake for some utility purposes
such as extracting versions, searching for strings etc.

## The `rules.vc` file

This is the heart of the current nmake system and remains so, with
enhancements to include as much of project-independent functionality
as possible. The file is responsible for

* Determining the compiler environment including target architecture,
supported compiler switches etc.

* Parsing any options and macros supplied by the user on the command
line

* Extracting version numbers, include paths etc.

* Defining compiler and linker switches, output paths, and standard
targets based on the above.

It is intended that there will be only one "master" `rules.vc` file,
the one in the Tcl repository where all changes are made. Extensions
will have unmodified copies of this if they need to be build against
older versions of Tcl. Otherwise, they will use the one installed with
Tcl or from the Tcl sources if building against the latter.

## The `targets.vc` file

This file, optionally included by the extension's master makefile,
defines some standard targets that relieves the extension from having
to define its own. It is separated from `rules.vc` so as to permit
master makefile to modify macros set by `rules.vc` before they
are expanded in the target rules.

## Writing a makefile for an extension

In the simplest case, a makefile for a Tcl extension would look like:

>
	PROJECT=sample
	!include "rules-ext.vc"
	PROJECT_OBJS = $(TMP_DIR)\sample.obj \
	               $(TMP_DIR)\util.obj \
    !if !$(STATIC_BUILD)
                   $(TMP_DIR)\sample.res
	!endif
	!include "targets.vc"

This suffices to generate shared, static and debug versions of the
extension by invoking `nmake` as

>
	nmake /f makefile.vc INSTALLDIR=/path/to/tcl
	nmake /f makefile.vc INSTALLDIR=/path/to/tcl OPTS=static
	nmake /f makefile.vc INSTALLDIR=/path/to/tcl OPTS=debug

respectively. In addition, it also includes generation of the install
target so that

>
    nmake /f makefile.vc INSTALLDIR=/path/to/tcl install

will install the extension including generation of a pkgIndex.tcl
file if necessary.

In case of a Tk extension, the following line is needed
before including `rules-ext.vc`.

>
    PROJECT_REQUIRES_TK = 1

There will be cases where the above does not suffice. For example,
the default rules do not generate and install
documentation as Tcl extensions do not have a common format and
structure for the same. In simple cases like this, the appropriate
target can be extended with additional commands:

>
    install: install-docs
    $(CPY) $(DOCDIR)\*.html "$(DOC_INSTALL_DIR)"

Note `CPY`, `DOCDIR` and `DOC_INSTALL_DIR` are all predefined or
computed macros within rules.vc.

In more complicated cases, the default make rules can be customized
through definition of macros that control it before including the
`rules-ext.vc` file in the parent makefile. In the extreme case,
the parent makefile can ignore the implicit rules and targets defined
by the system and simply make use of a standard set macros that
encapsulate the compiler and linker options to be used.

The next few sections go into more detail about using the nmake build
system and its customization.
