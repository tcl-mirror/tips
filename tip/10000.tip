~ Abstract

This proposal has no content.  It exists only to provide a document
on which testing of and practice using of the TIP editing interfaces
can take place.

~ Notes

Note that the State of this TIP is Draft and the Vote of this
TIP is Pending only because those values are required to enable
web editing.  In fact there will be no voting on this TIP because
it has not content.

~ References

This document serves a purpose similar to the Graffiti page
(http://purl.org/thecliff/tcl/wiki/34.html) at the Tcl'ers
Wiki (http://purl.org/thecliff/tcl/wiki/).

It will also be useful for testing the web editing interface
proposed in [13].

~ Test

Attempt to add a new section via the web interface (in a frame).

Are anonymous changes possible?

~ Testing the interface

<Andreas Kupries>
Just my first try at the new web editing interface for TIPs.

Hm ... Maybe we could add a direkt reference to [3] to the
edit page for easy/quick lookup of the formatting (rules|definition).
It should open into its own window, immediately, when following the link.

I miss a button or some such which allows me to enter a new
TIP. Currently it seems as if I can just edit an existing
document.
