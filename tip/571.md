# Abstract

The aim of this TIP is to make the TCLX's profiler working with Tcl 8.6. The fix was only required in the Tclx library. No changes have been occurred in Tcl core.

# Analysis

The profiler has exited with segmentation fault, as it has attempted to access to forbidden memory region. The exception has been thrown in function: ProfObjCommandEval:

"infoPtr->savedCmdInfo.objProc" could have a Null value. It happens when using the NRE tailcall command. By disabling the profile trace of tailcall (We don't want to profile the tailcall itself. As it can only be called in a procedure/lambda context), the issue has been solved.

# Example

profile on

proc sayHello {args} {

        after 2500

        puts hello

}

sayHello

sayHello


proc nre_proc {n} {

        puts "call: n := $n"

        incr n;

        if {$n < 10} {

                tailcall nre_proc $n

        }

}

nre_proc 0

profile off res;

profrep res cpu profdata.txt;
