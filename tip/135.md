# Abstract

[[130]](130.md) provides for unique DDE server name registration.  This TIP
renames one of the options it defines to better reflect its
behaviour.

# Rationale

The dde extension, as modified by [[130]](130.md), includes an option _-exact_
to force the name to be that specified.  This TIP proposes to change
this options name to _-force_ which better reflects its purpose.  As
[[130]](130.md) has only just been implemented, now is the time to make this
change before it is is included in any public release of Tcl.
