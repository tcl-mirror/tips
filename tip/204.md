# Abstract

Proposes using two new virtual events, **<<TraverseIn>>** and
**<<TraverseOut>>**, to notify widgets of keyboard navigation
events.

# Rationale

Certain widgets need to perform some action when they receive and/or
lose keyboard focus because of keyboard traversal.  For example,
tabbing into an Entry or Spinbox widget selects the widget contents.

This cannot be done with a <FocusIn> binding, since widgets may
receive <FocusIn> events for reasons other than keyboard traversal.

Tk currently implements this feature with special-case logic that
checks the target window's widget class in the _tk::TabToWindow_
procedure.  The drawback to this approach is that it only works for
the built-in widgets; third party widget sets like
BWidget<http://tcllib.sf.net/> ,
IWidgets<http://sf.net/projects/incrtcl/> , and
Tile<http://tktable.sf.net/tile/>  must implement their own
workarounds.

# Proposal

Change the standard Tk bindings for <Key-Tab> and <Shift-Key-Tab> to
do the following:

 * Send a **<<TraverseOut>>** virtual event to the current focus
   window, if any;

 * Set the focus to the new window;

 * Send a **<<TraverseIn>>** virtual event to the new window.

Additionally, move the current code to handle traversal to Entry and
Spinbox widgets from _tk::TabToWindow_ to class bindings.

# Implementation

See Tk Patch \#976928<http://sourceforge.net/support/tracker.php?aid=976928> .

The BWidget package has used an identical scheme since version 1.7;
see Tcllib bug
\#720032<http://sourceforge.net/support/tracker.php?aid=720032>  for
details.
