# Abstract

This TIP proposes to extend the version delivered by "package require tcl"
(and "package require tk", and the same for any extension wanting to do this)

Example:
<pre>
$ tclsh8.7
% package require tcl
8.7a4+c59a73a540b8cfa7672fc48ec5acc2b7c9d146fad89c7400238f34886dca31e7.clang-1200.utf16
</pre>
   

# Specification

TODO

# Implementation

Implementation is in Tcl branch build-info, still highly experimental.

# Compatibility

This is 100% upwards compatible with Tcl 8.6.
