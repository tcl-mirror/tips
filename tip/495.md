# Abstract
This tip proposes that we switch extension development away from implementing automation
in autoconf and nmake and towards using Tcl.
# Rationale
A present day application developer has to use several more languages than simply Tcl
and C to develop extensions for the language. Binary packages require a developer to
master autoconf, Makefile and nmake. The reference Sample extension is really only useful
for very, very trivial extensions. And most TEA packages have no concept of how they
can populate a VFS for a kit, or bundle themselves as a zip file for proper packaging
in a TEAPOT.

As one of the developers in charge of fixing day to day problems in TEA, I find myself
writing a lot more sh than Tcl. And most of that writing is working around limitations
in the sh language itself.

SH and autoconf are not going away. We are just changing their role from "building our
make system" to "finding all the platform specific quirks so that Tcl can be our
make system".
