# Abstract

This TIP proposes to deprecate Tcl\_WinUtfToTChar() and Tcl\_WinTCharToUtf() and provide more flexible replacement functions.

# Rationale

The functions Tcl\_WinUtfToTChar() and Tcl\_WinTCharToUtf() originally were functions able to do two different conversions,
depending on the runtime platform: On Windows 95/98/ME they performed conversions between Utf-8 and the Windows default encoding
(usually cp1252), on later Windows versions they convert between Utf-8 and Utf-16. The length parameter of Tcl\_WinTCharToUtf()
always was in bytes, but most other Unicode-related Tcl functions expect their length in Unicode characters.

Since Windows 95/98/ME are not supported any more, it's time to fix this inconsistency.

# Specification

This document proposes:

 * Deprecate the following functions:

     Tcl\_WinUtfToTChar()

     Tcl\_WinTCharToUtf()

   If Tcl is compiled with either -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=6 (which is not officially supported) or -DTCL\_NO\_DEPRECATED, those functions will
   no longer be available for extensions. In Tcl 9.0, those functions will be completely removed.

 * New functions:
     
     Tcl\_Utf16ToUtfDString()
     
     Tcl\_UtfToUtf16DString()

     Those are the same as the _UniChar_ variants (Tcl\_UniCharToUtfDString/Tcl\_UtfToUniCharDString), but they use an "unsigned short"
     pointer type in their signature stead of a Tcl\_UniChar pointer type.
     In addition, Tcl\_Utf16ToUtfDString() now accepts the value -1 as length parameter.

     Those functions can be used if you want your extension to compile with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=3, -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4 or -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=6,
     but still want to use the 16-bit conversions independent on the TCL\_UTF\_MAX setting or Tcl\_UniChar type.

 * Enhance the Tcl\_UniCharToUtfDString() function such that the uniLength parameter is allowed to
   have the value -1.

# Compatibility

This is fully upwards compatible in Tcl 8.x, except if Tcl is compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=6 (not officially supported) or
-DTCL\_NO\_DEPRECATED. Starting with Tcl 9.0, the replacement functions should be used in stead.

# Reference Implementation

A reference implementation is available in  the **tip-548** branch.
