# Abstract

This TIP proposes to add a new qualifier to the Tcl_ThreadQueueEvent()
function in order to allow implicit thread wakeup on empty queue condition.

# Rationale

Most code using Tcl_ThreadQueueEvent() is immediately followed by a call
to Tcl_ThreadAlert(). This involves more than one pass through a critical
section locking the same process wide resource. By considering the queue
state (the empty condition) on causing the underlying Tcl_AlertNotifier()
which is the work horse of Tcl_ThreadAlert(), the Tcl_ThreadAlert() can
be completely left out, and the critical section must be locked/unlocked
only once instead of twice, reducing potential spurious wakeups.

# Specification

The new qualifier TCL_QUEUE_ALERT_IF_EMPTY is added for Tcl_ThreadQueueEvent()
eliminating the need to call Tcl_ThreadAlert() afterwards. This qualifier
checks for the state of the event queue of the target thread and perform
an implicit equivalent of Tcl_ThreadAlert() if the queue is empty
at the begin of Tcl_ThreadQueueEvent(). It can be used in combination
('|') with the already existing qualifiers.

# Compatibility

By using conditional compilation and preprocessor symbols it should be
in most cases possible to allow for backward compatibility, e.g.

<code>
 #if (TCL_MAJOR_VERSION > 8) || (TCL_MINOR_VERSION > 6)
  Tcl_ThreadQueueEvent(threadId, &event->header, TCL_QUEUE_TAIL|TCL_QUEUE_ALERT_IF_EMPTY);
 #else
  Tcl_ThreadQueueEvent(threadId, &event->header, TCL_QUEUE_TAIL);
  Tcl_ThreadAlert(threadId);
 #endif
</code>
