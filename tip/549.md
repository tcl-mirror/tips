# Abstract

This TIP proposes to make `--enable-64bit` the default

# Rationale

Since 64-bit systems are gradually taking over 32-bit systems, it makes sense to change the default from 32-bit to 64-bit.

# Specification

This document proposes:

 * If `configure` is run without `--enable-64bit` or `--disable-64bit`, then the script behaves
   as if --enable-64bit is given.

# Compatibility

If you want a 32-bit build, you should explicitly specify `--disable-64bit` with `configure`.
That will work with any Tcl version, older ones too.

# Reference Implementation

A reference implementation is available in  the **tip-549** branch.
