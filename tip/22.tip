~ Abstract

Obtaining access to elements of sublists in Tcl often requires nested
calls to the ''lindex'' command.  The indices are syntactically listed
in most-nested to least-nested order, which is the reverse from other
notations.  In addition, the nesting of command substitution brackets
further decreases readability.  This proposal describes an extension
to the ''lindex'' command that allows it to accept multiple index
arguments, in least-nested to most-nested order, to automatically
extract elements of sublists.

~ Rationale

The heterogeneous nature of Tcl lists allows them to be applied to a
number of useful data structures.  In particular, lists can contain
elements that are, themselves, valid lists.  In this document, these
elements are referred to as ''sublists.''

Extracting elements from sublists often requires nested calls to
''lindex.''  Consider, for example, the following Tcl script that
prints the center element of a 3-by-3 matrix:

|    set A {{1 2 3} {4 5 6} {7 8 9}}
|    puts [lindex [lindex $A 2] 2]

When these calls are deeply nested - e.g., embedded in an ''expr''
arithmetic expression, having results extracted through ''lrange,''
etc. - the results are difficult to read:

|# Print the sum of the center indices of two 3x3 matrices
|set p [expr {[lindex [lindex $A 2] 2] + [lindex [lindex $A 2] 2]}]
|
|# Get all but the last font in the following parsed structure:
|set pstruct {text {ignored-data
|                      { ... }
|		       }
|		       {valid-styles
|			   {justifiction {left centered right full}}
|			   {font {courier helvetica times}}
|		       }
|		 }
|return [lrange [lindex [lindex [lindex $pstruct 1] 2] 2] 0 end-1]

Note that the list of indices in the latter example is listed in the
reverse order of vector indices.  In most other languages/domains, the
last line might take on one of the following forms:

|return list_range(pstruct[2][2][1], 0, end-1);
|
|return pstruct[[2, 2, 1]][[0:-1]]
|
|temp = pstruct(2, 2, 1);
|result = range(temp, 0, length(temp) - 1);

Allowing the ''lindex'' command to accept multiple arguments would
allow this more-natural style of coding to be written in Tcl.

~ Specification

 1. Under this proposal, the syntax for the ''lindex'' command is to be
    modified to accept one of two forms:

|     lindex list indexList

    or

|     lindex list index1 index2...

    > In either form of the command, the ''list'' parameter is
      expected to be a well-formed Tcl list.

    > In the first form of the command, the ''indexList'' argument is
      expected to be a Tcl list comprising one or more list indices,
      each of which must be an integer, the literal string ''end'', or
      the literal string ''end-'' followed by an integer with no
      intervening whitespace.  The existing ''lindex'' command is a
      degenerate form of this first form, where the list comprises a
      single index.

    > In the second form of the command, each of the ''index''
      arguments is expected to be a list index, which again may be an
      integer, the literal string ''end'', or the literal string
      ''end-'' followed by an integer with no intervening whitespace.

 2. In either form of the command, once the ''indexList'' parameter
    is expanded, there is a single ''list'' parameter and one or
    more ''index'' parameters.  If there is a single ''index''
    parameter ''N'', the behavior is identical to today's ''lindex''
    command, and the command returns the ''N''th element of
    ''list''; if ''N'' is less than zero or at least the length of
    the list, a null string is returned.

 3. If more than one ''index'' parameter is given, then the behavior is
    defined recursively; the result of
|   lindex $list $index0 $index1 ...
    > or
|   lindex $list [list $index0 $index1 ...]
    > is indentical to that of
|   lindex [lindex $list $index0] $index1...
    > or, equivalently,
|   lindex [lindex $list $index0] [list $index1...]
    > (This specification does not constrain the implementation,
      which may be iterative, recursive, or even expanded inline.)

 4. When an invalid index is given, an error of the form, ''bad index
    "invalid_index": must be integer or end?-integer?'', where
    ''invalid_index'' is the first invalid index encountered, must be
    returned.

 5. If the list argument is malformed, the error resulting from an
    attempt to convert the list argument to a list must be returned.
    This behaviour is unchanged from the current implementation.

~ Side Effects

 1. Whether the result of the ''lindex'' operation is successful, the
    underlying Tcl_Obj that represents the list argument may have its
    internal representation invalidated or changed to that of a list.

~ Discussion

Some attention must be paid to giving the ''lindex'' command adequate
performance.  In particular, the implementation should address the
common case of

|    lindex $list $i

where ''$i'' is a "pure" integer (that is, one whose string
representation has not yet been formed).  If the above specification
is followed naively, the flow will be as follows.

Since ''objc'' is three, ''objv[[ 2 ]]'' is expected to be a list.
Since it is not, it must be converted from its string representation.
It does not have one yet, so the string representation must be formed.
Now the string representation is parsed as a list.  An array (of
length one) of Tcl_Obj pointers is allocated to hold the list in
question, and a Tcl_Obj is allocated to hold the single element.
Memory is allocated to hold the element's string representation.
Now the ''lindex'' command converts the first element of the list to
an index (in this case an integer).

This elaborate ballet of type shimmering requires converting the
integer to a string and back again.  It also requires four calls to
''ckalloc:''

 1. Allocate a buffer for the string representation.
 2. Allocate the array of Tcl_Obj pointers for the list
    representation.
 3. Allocate the Tcl_Obj that represents the first (and only) element
    of the list.
 4. Allocate a buffer for the string representation of that element.

And at the end, the result is the same integer that was passed as a
parameter originally.

To avoid all this overhead in the common case, the proposed
implementation shall (in the case where ''objc==3'')

 1. Test whether ''objv[[ 2 ]]'' designates an object whose internal
    representation holds an integer.  If so, simply use it as an index.
 2. Test whether ''objv[[ 2 ]]'' designates an object whose internal
    representation holds a list.  If so, perform the recursive
    extraction of indexed elements from sublists described above.
 3. Form the string representation of ''objv[[ 2 ]]'' and test whether
    it is ''end'' or ''end-'' followed by an integer.  If so, use it
    as an index.
 4. Attempt to coerce ''objv[[ 2 ]]' to an integer; if successful, use
    the result as an integer.
 5. Attempt to coerce ''objv[[ 2 ]]' to a list; if successful, use
    the result as an index list.
 6. Report a malformed ''index'' argument; the ''indexList'' parameter
    is not a well-formed list.

This logic handles all the cases of singleton lists transparently; it
is effectively a simple-minded type inference that optimizes away
needless conversions.

Assuming that the related [33] is approved, this logic will most
likely be combined with the identical logic required in that proposal
for parsing ''index'' arguments to the ''lset'' command.

~ Comments

''Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>''

 > I agree that it would be helpful to many programmers to
   provide a multi-dimensional array data structure that can
   be accessed in the manner described in this TIP.  In the
   ''struct'' module of ''tcllib'', several other data structures
   are being developed: graph, tree, queue, stack.  I would support
   adding another data structure to that module that provides an
   interface like the one described in this TIP, with the intent that
   all of these helpful data structures find their way into the
   BI distribution.

 > I don't see any advantage to adding complexity to [[lindex]]
   as an alternative to development of a multi-dimensional array
   structure.  Without a compelling advantage, I'm inclined against
   making [[lindex]] more complex.  I like having Tcl's built-in
   commands provide primitive operations, and leave it to
   packages to combine the primitives into more useful, more
   complex resources.

 > This TIP should also consider how any changes to [[lindex]] mesh
   with the whole [[listx]] overhaul of Tcl's [[list]] command that
   has been discussed.

''Dave Cuthbert <dacut@kanga.org> responds''

 > Don makes a good point -- with a good set of data structures in
   tcllib, the need for this TIP is lessened or even eliminated.
   Nonetheless, I see this as a way of implementing the structures he
   describes.  In other words, a more powerful primitive (which, in
   reality, adds fairly little complexity when measured in number of
   lines of code changed) would benefit these structures.

 > As for the [[listx]] overhaul, there are many competing proposals
   for the specification it is difficult to come up with a metric.  In
   writing this TIP, I assumed a vacuum -- that is, a listx command
   would not be added to the core in the near future.

''Donal K. Fellows <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk> points out''

 > Although there is tcllib and [[listx]] to think about, they are
   certainly not reasons for rejecting this TIP out of hand.  The
   availability of tcllib is not currently anything like universal
   (not stating whether this is a good, bad or ugly thing) and all the
   [[listx]] work will need its own TIP to make it into the core (you
   tend to have availability problems if it is an extension.)  It is
   not as if the core is short of syntactic sugar right now (the
   [[foreach]] command is ample demonstration of this.)

''Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net> follows up''

 > I'll leave the discussion above in place so the history
   of this TIP is preserved, but I have withdrawn my
   objection.

There was quite a discussion on news:comp.lang.tcl about using lindex
to return multiple arguments.  For example:

| % set list {a {b1 b2} c d e}
| % lindex $list 1
| b1 b2
| % lindex $list 1 0
| {b1 b2} a
| % lindex $list {1 0}
| b1

In other words, the list index arguments can, themselves, be lists.
Only when the argument is a list would the "recursive selection"
procedure of the TIP be used.  For multiple arguments, the behaviour
is akin to

| lindex $list a b c  ->
|      list [lindex $list a] [lindex $list b] [lindex $list c]

''Summarised by Dave Cuthbert <dacut@kanga.org>''

''Donal K. Fellows <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk> points out''

 > The problems with the above version of multiple indexing are that
   it loses the property that [[lindex]] always returns a single
   element (making writing robust code harder) and that it forces use
   of the [[list]] constructor a lot or inefficient type handling when
   some of the indices must be computed.  Then there is the whole
   question of what happens when you have indexes that are lists of
   lists, which is a major can of worms.

 > Luckily, we could always put this sort of behaviour into a separate
   command (e.g. called [[lselect]]) which addresses at least the
   majority of my concerns, and which (in my opinion) need not even
   form part of this TIP.

''Dave Cuthbert <dacut@kanga.org> adds''

 > I intentionally left [[lselect]] out of the original TIP (and it
   is still not present in the 02-April-2001 version).  As Donal points
   out, it is a major can of worms and, though there was general
   agreement on c.l.t that such a command would be useful, people had
   differing opinions on what form it should take.

 > Perhaps my view on TIPs is incorrect, but I try to include only
   sure-fire "yeah, we ought to have done that a few versions ago"
   items.

~ Notes on History of this TIP

''This TIP was originally written by Dave Cuthbert <dacut@kanga.org>,
but ownership has passed (beginning of April) to Kevin Kenny
<kennykb@acm.org>.''

This TIP underwent substantial revision in May of 2001, to add the
syntax where all the ''index'' parameters could be grouped as a list
rather than placed inline on the command line.
