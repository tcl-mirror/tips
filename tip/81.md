# Abstract

This document proposes a division of [incr Tcl]'s source code into
functional areas so that each area may be assigned to one or more
maintainers.

# Background

In order for [incr Tcl] to be adopted by the Tcl Core Team \(see
[[50]](50.md)\), it must be managed by the processes already established for
handling source \(see [[0]](0.md) and [[16]](16.md) for details and rationale.\)

# Functional Areas

[incr Tcl] shall be divided into the following 8 functional units
\(the seventh is the obsolete parts of the source tree, and the eighth
is the shared part of the source tree\), each to be assigned one or
more maintainers:

 1. _Objects_ -
      generic/itcl\_bicmds.c,
      generic/itcl\_class.c,
