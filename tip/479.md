# Abstract

This TIP proposes an enhancement of the Tcl language to support named
parameters when defining a procedure or OO method.

# Rationale

Adding a new argument to commands and methods is fairly simple in Tcl. Finding all
of the references in your code where you call that command (or method)
and padding in extra arguments, however, is a painful process. A pain that is
magnified exponentially with the size of your project. While Tcl does provide
the _args_ facility for optional arguments beyond the positional arguments,
that facility does not populate local variables, nor provide any meaning or
context beyond _Thar be dragons_. Well, dragons and a list called **args**
that the called procedure needs to sort out by itself.

In the Tk world we mitigate this complexity by having as few positional arguments
as possible, and instead providing a rich set of optional configuration flags.
The flipside is that those options need to be registered ahead of time in a massive
option database. Also, those option/value pairs go directly into C data structures,
they at no time feed a script with local variables.

# Specification

This TIP calls for a new command, provisionally named **@proc**. _@proc_ will
accept the same number of arguments as _proc_, but the format for the argument
spec will be a dict instead of a list. The fields in the dict will be the name
of a local variable that the argument will populate, if given. The value will be
a key/value list of options that tailor how the argument parser treats that
incoming value (or lack of value.)

Named parameters are designed to be deliverable in any order. Named parameters
can also be omitted. As such it is necessary to provide more introspection than the
current incarnation of **proc** provides. If the procedure requires
more than the default behavior or populating local variables with the argumemnt given,
it can introspect with **$args** with **\[dict exists\]** to detect if an argument was
given at all. The argument spec that was given by the developer will also be available
as the local variable **@spec**.

		% @proc p {a {default {}}} { return $args }
		% p
		a {}
		% p foo bar
		a {} foo bar

Given these rules, we can get into non-intuitive failures. For instance, what would
happen if a default value was not provided for an argument, and the command call
does not provide one.

		% @proc q {a {default {}} b {}} {
		  # Proc assumes b will be given
		  set result [list $a $b]
		  foreach {f v} $args {
		    if {$item ni [dict keys ${@spec}]} {
		       lappend result $item [dict get $args $item]
		    }
		  }
		}
		% q
		error: No such variable b ; # Stack trace points to first use if $b
		% q b foo bar baz
		a {} b foo bar baz

It would be helpful to have that field (b) treated as a mandatory argument,
and have the error thrown in the procedure's argument parser, not in the procedure
itself. After some play testing with the rules I have worked out what properties will
be tracked for each named parameter, and how those properties are calculated if not
specified directly in the options.

## Configuration Options for Named Parameters

The following general rules apply to all values given in the configuration dict for
a named parameter.

1. If a value for any option is given as an empty string, it is inferred to be null.
2. The value for the *variable* option will be the name of the parameter unless set.
3. A field that is given, but not otherwise reserved by the spec, is ignored by the parser but made available for introspection via the **@spec** dictionary.
4. If the same option is given multiple times, the last value is the one that will be used. (Similar to \[dict merge\]).

### variable
Type: Variable name
Default: null

If given, instead of creating a local variable matching the name of the named parameter,
create a variable named **$variable** containing the value provided in the call.
Example:

		% @proc u {
		  a { variable A }
		} {
		  puts $A
		}

### mandatory
Type: boolean
Default: true

Set to false if **default** given. If true, throw an error if the named parameter is not given.

### default
Type: value
Default: null

When non-null, if a named parameter is missing from the call assume the value specified.

Example:

		% @proc u {
		  a { default {A useful value} }
		} {
		  puts $a
		}
		% u
		> A useful value
		% u a {Less usefull}
		> Less usefull

### aliases
Type: list
Default: null

A list of alternative names for this parameter. To resolve any potentials conflicts,
the following rules apply to aliases:

1. If a parameter with the canonical name is given, alternatives will be ignored.
2. If multiple non-canonical parameters are given, the last value given will be the value for the canonical field.

Example:

		% @proc u {
		  a {
		    default {A useful value}
		    aliases {alpha A}
		  }
		} {
		  puts [list $a $args]
		}
		% u
		> {A useful value} {}
		% u a {Less usefull}
		> {Less usefull} {a {Less usefull}}
		% u alpha {Less usefull}
		> {Less usefull} {a {Less usefull} alpha {Less usefull}}
		% u a {Don't be pedantic} alpha {Less usefull}
		> {Don't be pedanditic} {a {Don't be pedantic} alpha {Less usefull}}

# Option - Backfit into the existing **proc** command

Because named **args** need to follow positional arguments, it is possible to backfit this
technique into the existing proc command by modifying to the **args** facility to accept an argspec.

		% proc p {{a {}} {args {b {default {}}}}} { return [list a: $a b: $b {*}$args] }
		% p
		a: {} b: {}
		% p foo bar
		a: {} b: {} foo bar

# Implementation

This TIP will be rolled out in 3 stages.

## Stage 1 - Pure Tcl

Stage 1 is a pure-tcl implementation to allow the community to try out the rules and
see if this new concept is a good fit for Tcl. The implementation will use a macro-like
template to place the implementation rules as a pre-amble to the body given to @proc or
@method. This implementation will affect line numbers in traces, but should provide
the new features without introducing a major impact on performance.

This implementation has been posted to the http://wiki.tcl.tk/49071 and will be kept up
to date.

## State 2 - C Extension

Stage 2 will be a standalone TEA extension compatible with Tcl 8.6. In this implementation
a C API call will create a command **@args** which will take as input the parameter specs
for the proc and the value of the args variable. The @args command will then provide the
local variables for this tip's rules prior to passing control to the user's body.

## State 3 - Core patch

Stage 3 will introduce named parameters as a feature of the core. An additional field will
be added to the Proc data structure which, when non-null, will indicate that this
procedure has named arguments. This data structure will also contain the information
required to enforce the rules for the named arguments.

The **@proc** c implementation will populate this named parameters data structure
for all calls, and provide a *args* for the argument pointer accessed by
standard procs. The rules for named parameters will be expressed in the InitArgsAndLocals() function.

For TclOO, The **@method** method in TclOO will also populate this data structure.

## State 4 - Change behaviors of **proc** and **::oo::class method**

At stage 4 we will modify the **proc** command behavior and **::oo::class method** behavior.
To do this we will modify the TclCreateCommand() function to populate the named arguments data structure
in cases where the final argument is **args** with an argspec.
