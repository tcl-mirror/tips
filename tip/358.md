# Abstract

The **split** command will create empty list elements when adjacent split
characters are found in the input. In some cases these empty list elements are
not desired, so this TIP proposes a new switch to disable their generation.

# Rationale

The idea for this TIP came from a discussion in comp.lang.tcl:
<http://groups.google.gr/group/comp.lang.tcl/browse_thread/thread/8d46b0f10e7a5750/d7844cc739aa4310> 
and the \(non obvious\) suggestions on how tokens can be extracted from a string
can be performed efficiently.

It should be noted that this will allow the **split** command to be used in
a fashion that is very similar to how splitting works in many other languages
\(e.g., Perl, awk, Unix shells\).

# Specification

This TIP proposes a new optional switch \(**-noemptyelements**\) to the
**split** command:

 > **split -noemptyelements** _string_ ?_splitChars_?

If this option is present, then **split** will not produce an empty list
element when the _string_ contains adjacent characters that are present in
_splitChars_.

# Reference Implementation

Currently there is no patch, but it should be quite easy to implement this.
