# Abstract

Entry fields should support the ability to display informational text when no text is given.

# Rationale

Entry fields, p.e. search boxes in browsers, have the ability to display some help text inside if no real value is given.
The text is with a lighter color and is removed if the user enters some real text.

The **entry** and **ttk::entry ttk::spinbox ttk::combobox** commands can easily enhanced to provide this
support, and there is no interference with existing code as this
functionality can be done by just introducing new options.

# Specification

A help text can be displayed on **entry** and **ttk::entry ttk::spinbox ttk::combobox** widgets if no text is otherwise displayed.
To control the text appearance the following new options will be added:

 -emptytext: The string to display.

 -emptyforeground: The color of the text.

If the -emptytext is empty (the default value) then nothing is displayed.

The -emptyforeground has a default value of #b3b3b3 (gray70).

The -emptytext value is always displayed with current font and left justification.

# Discussion

- The naming of the options should start with a common prefix. This prefix can be changed from empty to p.e. help.

- The default value for the -emptyforeground option needs to be specified?

- Are -emptyfont and -emptyjustify options necessary?

# Implementation

A patch implementing these changes and updating the documentation is available.

The patch is in the fossil repository in the tip-496 branch.

# Example of use

	    package require Tk
	    grid [::ttk::entry .e];#normal display
	    .e configure -emptytext test;#display text is: test
	    .e configure -emptybackground red;#display text is now red
	    .e insert end xxx;#display text is xxx, color is black
	    .e configure -textvariable a; set a yyy;##display text is yyy
	    set a {};#display text is test, color is red
