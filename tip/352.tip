England going for a win - Carroll
<a href=http://www.messif50.com>messi f50</a>
The Liverpool striker, who scored the opening goal against Sweden, said: "We think we can finish the job against Ukraine. We are confident. We showed what we are about against Sweden after going behind and have put ourselves in with a good chance of qualifying. Things are in our hands."
Andy Carroll insists England will not settle for the draw against Ukraine, which would book their place in the quarter-finals of Euro 2012, but still aim to win.
Roy Hodgson's side need only a point to qualify for the last eight after the 1-1 draw with France and 3-2 win over Sweden. But Carroll is adamant England will look to end Group D on a positive note.
