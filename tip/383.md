# Abstract

This proposes a new command, **coroinject**, that allows a programmer to
inject arbitrary code into a suspended coroutine, for execution on next
resumption.

# Rationale

When debugging complex coroutines - with many yield points and possibly rich
state in local variables - sometimes one would like to inspect their state
"from the outside", i.e., at a point where they are suspended.

A typical situation is that of a big, single-threaded, event\+coro system,
where the coro happily enables/disables fileevents along its life, and the
fileevents are one way to resume the coro. At a given point \(bug\), things get
stalled, with the fileevents disabled. The obvious questions are:

 1. "where" is the coro \(at which yield site\)? and

 2. what are the values of its local variables?

Both these questions can be answered with the new **coroinject** primitive.
The idea is to force a resumption of the coro along with an "immediate
execution of extra code" directive, where the extra code says "dump the call
stack with **info level** and **info frame**", or "dump the locals", etc.

Another use would be to inject "**return -code return**", as an alternative
to renaming to \{\} for terminating the coro in a way that respects its
**catch**/**finally** termination handlers. Alternatively, returning with
an error code will have the effect of gathering call stack information in the
**-errorstack** options dictionary entry.

At the other end of the spectrum, the injected code can be completely
transparent: either with a forced resumption and injected code ending with
**yield**, or merely waiting for normal resumption when the app sees fit,
and injected code falling back to normal coro code.

Note that the feature is similar to a proc-entry trace, but coroutine
resumption is not currently a trace target.  Also, it is an intrinsically
"one-shot" mechanism, which makes it a better fit for its debugging purposes.

# Definition

The new command

 > **coroinject** _coroname_ _cmd_ ?_arg1 ..._?

prepends to the code to be executed on resumption of the currently suspended
coroutine, _coroname_, the following code:

 >  _cmd_ _arg1..._ _resumearg_

where _resumearg_ is the single argument passed to the resumption command
_coroname_.  In turn, the result from the execution of _cmd_ will be seen
by the coroutine's code as the result of **yield**.

Note that:

 1. Resumption itself must be done separately, by calling _coroname_ later,

 2. If **coroinject** is called several times on the same _coroname_
    before resuming it, the commands pile up in LIFO order.

 3. In combination, the appending of _resumearg_ and the use of the result
    of _cmd_ to provide the result of **yield**, will allow the following
    style of fully transparent injection:

		    proc probe {x y resumearg} {do things $x $y;return $resumearg}
		    coroinject C probe foo bar

# Naming

Of course, the proposed **coroinject** is a placeholder for a suitable name. Alternatives that also make sense are: **::tcl::coroinject** and **interp coroinject**. Constructive bikeshedding welcome.

# Reference Implementation

The current **::tcl::unsupported::inject** implements most of the
functionality described here, minus the _resumearg_ passing.  It will be
updated to include it if consensus gathers on this style.
