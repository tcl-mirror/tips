# Abstract

Modern operating systems have a "system tray", where programs may place an
icon to indicate program status. This TIP proposes that Tk should adopt some
existing code in order to permit cross platform access to this functionality.

# Existing code

 * Windows: winico

 * Linux: tktray

 * Mac: ???

Existing code is sufficient, and utilizes an acceptable license in order to
repurpose it for a systray command.

# Interface

To be determined by the TCT, but along the lines of what tktray provides:

 > **tktray::icon** _pathName_ ?_options_?

Create a new icon for the system tray. The application managing the system
tray is notified about the new icon. It normally results in the icon being
added to the tray. If there is no system tray at the icon creation time, the
icon will be invisible. When a new system tray appears, the icon will be added
to it. Options:

 **-class** _class_: WM\_CLASS attribute for the icon window. Tray manager may use
         class name to remember icon position or other attributes.

 **-image** _photo_: image to show in the system tray. The value must be the name of a
         photo image. Transparency data of the photo are used to set the
         window's shape. The icon will be automatically redrawn or resized
         appropriately on any image modifications.

 **-visible** _flag_: boolean value indicating whether the icon must be visible. The
         system tray manager continues to manage the icon whether it is
         visible or not. Thus when invisible icon becomes visible, its
         position on the system tray is likely to remain the same.
