# Abstract

Modern operating systems have a "system tray", where programs may place an
icon to indicate program status. This TIP proposes that Tk should adopt some
existing code in order to permit cross platform access to this functionality. 
This TIP also proposes to implement system notification windows, which have become 
popular across all platforms.

# Design

 * Windows: winico

 * X11: tktray

 * Mac: New development

Existing code from the winico and tktray extension packages has been refactored and ported into Tk's core; this code utilizes an acceptable license in order to repurpose it for a systray command. The sysnotify command will be a new implementation. On Windows and Mac it will make use of native system API's, and on X11 it will include a conditional dependency on libnotify, falling back to a pure-Tcl implementation (derived from the "notifywindow" tklib package) if libnotify is not present. 

Both the systray and the sysnotify commands will present a script-level public API implementing the proposed interface, outlined below. The C code will implement an internal "_systray" and "_sysnotify" API owing to the significantly different designs of winico and tktray. The Mac version, while new for this TIP, will follow this general design as well.

# Systray Interface

 > **-systray create** _image_ _text_ _callback_

Creates a new icon for the system tray with a Tk image, a string for display in a tooltip, and an optional callback. 

> **-systray modify** _option?_ 

Modifies either the image, string, or callback.

> **-systray destroy** 

Deallocates the statustray icon and remove it from view.

# Sysnotify Interface

> **-sysnotify notify** _title_ _message_ 

Creates and display a system notification with a brief title and longer body message.

# Example

systray:

	image create photo book -data R0lGODlhDwAPAKIAAP//////AP8AAMDAwICAgAAAAAAAAAAAACwAAAAADwAPAAADSQhA2u5ksPeKABKSCaya29d4WKgERFF0l1IMQCAKatvBJ0OTdzzXI1xMB3TBZAvATtB6NSLKleXi3OBoLqrVgc0yv+DVSEUuFxIAOw==

    systray create image book text "Systray sample" callback {puts "Here is the systray output"}

systnotify:

	sysnotify notify "Alert" "This is just a test of the Tk System Notification Code."

# Implementation 

A draft implementation is currently under development in the tip_325 branch.
