# Abstract

This TIP makes it easier for people to write procedures to extend TclOO's
definition sublanguage.

# Rationale

One of the fundamental features of Tcl is that you can extend it with more
capabilities by writing your own procedures \(and other commands, if you prefer
the C API\). However, it is somewhat awkward to do so when using TclOO, as the
**oo::define** and **oo::objdefine** commands don't make it easy to find
out what the context class or object is.

For example, in the _oo::util_ package of Tcllib, the code for discovering
what the context class is includes this
<http://core.tcl-lang.org/tcllib/artifact/51d71f560ceb7d63?ln=77> :

	    # Get the name of the current class or class delegate 
	    set cls [namespace which [lindex [info level -1] 1]]

That is ugly, and won't even work reliably for getting the context object in
**oo::objdefine** as that can be entered into by multiple paths \(i.e.,
there's a shortcut from **oo::define**\).

# Proposed Change

I propose to make the existing **self** command in **oo::define**, when
invoked without arguments, return the context class \(provided it is evaluated
in the correct stack frame, as usual with definition commands\).  Similarly, I
also propose to add a **self** command to the **oo::objdefine** system
that takes no arguments and returns the context object.

This will enable to code listed above in the _Rationale_ to become:

	    # Get the name of the current class or class delegate 
	    set cls [uplevel 1 self]

In the C API, I propose adding a function:

 > Tcl\_Object **Tcl\_GetDefineContextObject**\(Tcl\_Interp \*_interp_\)

which will get the context object, or return NULL and put an error in the
interpreter if there is no context object in the frame or the context object
has been deleted. The functionality is that of **TclOOGetDefineCmdContext**
in _tclOODefineCmds.c_
<http://core.tcl-lang.org/tcl/artifact/7d58f1a701168168?ln=682> , but the text
of the error messages might be changed.
