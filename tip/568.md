# Abstract

PLEASE HOLD YOUR COMMENTS WHILE UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

This TIP revises the public routines **Tcl_GetByteArrayObj** and
**Tcl_SetByteArrayLength** to signal an error when they are passed
an _objPtr_ that does not contain a valid byte sequence.

# Background



# History and Rationale

# Specification

# Compatibility

# Scope

This TIP proposes a change to **Tcl_GetByteArrayFromObj** that is an
incompatibity in its return value.  There is also interest (see [TIP 481])
in making another incompatible change to the same routine in the type of
its final output argument. It is out of scope to merge these concerns.
They can be accompilshed as orthogonal matters in either sequence.

# Reference Implementation
