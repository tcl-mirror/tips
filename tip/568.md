# Abstract

PLEASE HOLD YOUR COMMENTS WHILE UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

This TIP revises the public routines **Tcl_GetByteArrayObj** and
**Tcl_SetByteArrayLength** to signal an error when they are passed
an _objPtr_ that does not contain a valid byte sequence.

# Background

It is a convention of the Tcl C interface to have routines with names
like **Tcl_GetFooFromObj**. Their purpose is to extract a value in
the _foo_ representation from a (*Tcl_Obj* _*_) argument. The caller
should then be able to process the extracted _foo_ value 
confident that it represents the original *Tcl_Obj* value.
Each one of these routines is associated with one or more **Tcl_ObjType**s
such that multiple calls to **Tcl_GetFooFromObj** can benefit from
internal representation caching.

These routines follow one of three patterns. The first,

> _int_ **Tcl_GetFooFromObj**(*Tcl_Interp* _*_, *Tcl_Obj* _*_, ..., _foo *_);

is used when the *foo* representation is of fixed size that is not too large.
The _int_ return allows for returning **TCL_ERROR** when no valid *foo*
can be extracted. The *Tcl_Interp* is provided to receive standardized
error messages and codes on failure.  The final output argument is a pointer
to space where the extracted *foo* value may be written. The value written
is now the possession of the caller, generated by the routine, possible by
making a copy of something stored in the *Tcl_Obj*.  This pattern is followed
in the cases where **Foo** is **Boolean**, **Bignum**, **Double**,
**Encoding**, **Index**, **Int**, **Long**, or **WideInt**.

The second pattern,

> _foo_ **Tcl_GetFooFromObj**(*Tcl_Interp* _*_, *Tcl_Obj* _*_, ...);

is used when the *foo* representation is a token that can take on
the value **NULL**.  In this case, a return of **NULL** by the routine
signals the circumstance that no valid *foo* can be extracted. As in
the first pattern, a *Tcl_Interp* is provided to receive standardized
error messages and codes on failure. Documentation must be consulted
to determine any constraints on the use of the returned token value by
the caller.  It is likely to rely on information stored within the internal
structures of Tcl, which may need management with reference counting,
memory preservation, and/or maintaining a claim on the original *Tcl_Obj*.
This pattern is followed in the cases where **Foo** is **RegExp**
or **Command**.

The final pattern,

> _foo_ **Tcl_GetFooFromObj**(*Tcl_Obj* _*_, _int *_);

is used when the returned *foo* is a pointer value pointing into
an array stored within Tcl's own structures.  It is implicit in the
structure of the interface that it is presumed this extraction cannot
fail. Thus there is no need to arrange for an interpreter to receive
error messages or codes. The caller is instructed that the return value
need not be checked for **NULL**. The final output argument is a pointer to
space where the length of the *foo* array returned may be written.
Documentation must be consulted to determine the conditions under which
the caller my read, or even write, to that array. This pattern is
followed in the cases where **Foo** is **String**, **Unicode**,
or **ByteArray**.

Again it must be understood that all of these routines have value only
so far as they produce a *foo* value that caller can use in the place
of operating directly on the *Tcl_Obj*.  Experience has proven that
the existing specification of the routine **Tcl_GetByteArrayFromObj**
fails that test.

# History and Rationale

Starting with release 8.1, Tcl string values have been composed of
characters from an international character set. Each string is conceived
as a sequence of characters from UCS-2.  Each routine accepting a string
as a *char* array, and the string representation of each *Tcl_Obj* expect
to store a UCS-2 sequence in a Modified UTF-8 encoding.  This change
created the need for a new mechanism to accept, transmit, store, and
produce arbitrary binary values, preferably while minimizing the need to
convert to other representations.

The _bytearray_ **Tcl_ObjType** was created to address this need. The
routine **Tcl_NewByteArrayObj** stores an arbitrary byte sequence in
a *Tcl_Obj*.  The routine **Tcl_GetByteArrayFromObj** can then retrieve
that same sequence.  

When the string representation of the value is
needed each byte (with value from 0-255) in the sequence is treated
as the corresponding UCS-2 codepoint (U+0000 - U+00FF), and that
UCS-2 sequence is encoded in Modified UTF-8 in the usual way.  This
strategy permits all byte sequences to be encoded in a subset of
Tcl string values. 

When a byte sequence is not present, but one is
needed, it may be generated from the string representation. When
the string is one from the subset produced by encoding byte sequences,
the decoding is clear, but what about other string values, those that
contain at least one codepoint greater than U+00FF?  It was decided
that any larger codepoint in the string value would have its high
bits stripped away, and be decoded based on the low 8 bits it contained.
Given this decision, all strings produce a byte sequence, and
**Tcl_GetByteArrayFromObj** could be defined using the patterns that
never produces errors.  This decision is the source of all the trouble.







# Specification

# Compatibility

# Scope

This TIP proposes a change to **Tcl_GetByteArrayFromObj** that is an
incompatibity in its return value.  There is also interest (see [TIP 481])
in making another incompatible change to the same routine in the type of
its final output argument. It is out of scope to merge these concerns.
They can be accompilshed as orthogonal matters in either sequence.
