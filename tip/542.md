# Abstract

This TIP proposes being able to switch Tcl between Full Unicode mode
(TCL\_UTF\_MAX>3, almost compatible with Androwish) and current partial
Unicode mode (as far as TIP #389 goes, using `TCL_UTF_MAX=3`)

Full Unicode mode means that \[string length \\U10000\] will no longer
return `2` but the expected `1`, so Unicode characters larger than \\uFFFF
will no longer internally be split into two surrogate characters.

# Rationale

Tcl currently can be compiled in 3 different modes: using TCL\_UTF\_MAX=3, TCL\_UTF\_MAX=4
or TCL\_UTF\_MAX=6. The first 2 are actually equal now in Tcl 8.7 (since TIP #389). Using
TCL\_UTF\_MAX=6 is actually overkill, since no utf-8 character consists of more than 4 bytes.

Therefore it makes sense to reduce this to only two modes: TCL\_UTF\_MAX=3 means
being fully compatible with Tcl 8.6, while TCL\_UTF\_MAX=4 means compatibility with
the Androwish-version of Tcl. Defining TCL\_UTF\_MAX=6 results in a valid
compilation as well (functioning the same as TCL\_UTF\_MAX=4), only some buffer-sizes
will be 2 bytes larger than necessary.

Androwish made the choice to use an (at that time) un-supported Tcl mode: Changing the size
of the Tcl\_UniChar type using TCL\_UTF\_MAX=6. This causes a binary incompatibility
which results that all extensions need to be re-compiled with TCL\_UTF\_MAX=6 as well.
This TIP proposes to add a supported TCL\_UTF\_MAX=4 compilation mode to Tcl, which has
the same effect as the earlier unsupported TCL\_UTF\_MAX=6, but without the need to
re-compile all extensions.

The default compilation mode for Tcl 8.x will continue to be TCL\_UTF\_MAX=3, which is 100%
upwards compatible with Tcl 8.6.

# Specification

This document proposes:

 * Allow Tcl to be compiled with either -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=3 (default), or with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4.
   In the latter mode, the Tcl_UniChar type becomes a 32-bit type.

 * Allow Tcl extensions to be compiled with either -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=3 (default), or with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4,
   independent from how Tcl is compiled.

 * Deprecate the following functions:

     Tcl\_AppendUnicodeToObj()

     Tcl\_UniCharCaseMatch()

     Tcl\_UniCharLen()

     Tcl\_UniCharNcmp()

     Tcl\_UniCharNcasecmp()

   If Tcl is compiled with either -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4 or -DTCL\_NO\_DEPRECATED, those functions will no longer be available for extensions.
   In Tcl 9.0 those 5 functions will be completely gone.

 * Deprecate the following functions when Tcl is compiled in a different -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX mode than the extension.

     Tcl\_GetUnicode()

     Tcl\_GetUnicodeFromObj()

     Tcl\_NewUnicodeObj()

     Tcl\_SetUnicodeObj()

   If Tcl is compiled with a different TCL\_UTF\_MAX value than the extension, those 4 functions cannot be used.
   In order to keep binary compatibility with 8.6, those 4 functions are not supported for extensions compiled
   with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4. You can use the functions in TIP #548 instead, for converting between Tcl_UniChar
   and UTF-8.

# Compatibility

As long as Tcl is compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=3, this is fully upwards compatible.

When Tcl is compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4, this is at the Tcl level, compatible with the Androwish-version
of Tcl. At the C-API level, it's upwards compatible with Tcl 8.6 in TCL\_UTF\_MAX=6 mode, except for the
functions mentioned above.

# Caveats

 * Extensions compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4 cannot use any of the deprecated functions mentioned in this TIP.
   Using any of them results in a link error.

 * If Tcl is compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4, the deprecated functions will be removed from the stub-table. Any
   extension using those, even if the extension is compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=3, won't work any more: This
   results in a panic clearly indicating the problem.
