# Abstract

This TIP proposes to add more encodings, and being able to switch Tcl
between Full Unicode mode (TCL\_UTF\_MAX>3, almost compatible with Androwish) and
current partial Unicode mode (as far as TIP #389 goes, using TCL\_UTF\_MAX=3) 

# Summary

TODO

# Rationale

TODO

# Specification

This document proposes:

 * Add new encodings "utf-16", "utf-16le", "utf-16le", "ucs-2", "ucs-2le", "ucs-2le".

 * Allow Tcl to be compiled with either -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=3 (default), or with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4.
   In the latter mode, the Tcl_UniChar type becomes a 32-bit type, but the stub entries for
   the 16-bit Tcl\_UniChar type are present as well. So, extensions compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=3
   will continue to work in either Tcl mode.

 * Allow Tcl extensions to be compiled with either -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=3 (default), or with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4,
   when Tcl is compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4.

 * Deprecate the "unicode" encoding. "utf-16" is supposed to be used in stead. The "unicode" encoding
   will NOT be removed in Tcl 9.0, since it's too common.

 * New functions:

     Tcl\_UtfToUtf16()
     
     Tcl\_Utf16ToUtfDString()
     
     Tcl\_UtfToUtf16DString()
     
     Tcl\_Utf16Len()
     
     Tcl\_Utf16Ncmp()
     
     Tcl\_Utf16Ncasecmp()
     
     Tcl\_Utf16CaseMatch()

     Those are the same as the _UniChar_ variants, but they use "unsigned short" type in stead of Tcl\_UniChar. 

TODO: everything else that comes up

# Compatibility

As long as Tcl is compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=3, this is fully Upwards compatible.

When Tcl is compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4, this is at the Tcl level, compatible with the Androwish-version
of Tcl with one exception: In Androwish the "unicode" encoding is 32-bit, in Tcl it
continues to be 16-bit, an alias for "utf-16". At the C-API level, it's upwards compatible with
Tcl 8.6, except for the following 5 functions: Tcl\_NewUnicodeObj(), Tcl\_SetUnicodeObj(),
Tcl\_GetUnicode(), Tcl\_GetUnicodeFromObj() and Tcl\_AppendUnicodeToObj(). Using any of those 5 functions
will result in a panic.

# Caveats

 * If Tcl is compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=3, extensions compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4 and use the
   Tcl\_UniChar type won't work. This will result in a panic, as soon as one of the 32-bit
   Tcl\_UniChar functions is called.

 * Internally, there is only one "Unicode" Tcl\_Obj-type. This means that any extension using
   Tcl\_NewUnicodeObj(), Tcl\_SetUnicodeObj(), Tcl\_GetUnicode(), Tcl\_GetUnicodeFromObj() or Tcl\_AppendUnicodeToObj()
   MUST be compiled in the same mode as Tcl.

# Reference Implementation

A reference implementation is ongoing in  the **utf-max** branch.
