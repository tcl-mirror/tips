# Abstract

This TIP proposes being able to switch Tcl between Full Unicode mode
(TCL\_UTF\_MAX>3, almost compatible with Androwish) and current partial
Unicode mode (as far as TIP #389 goes, using TCL\_UTF\_MAX=3) 

# Rationale

Tcl currently can be compiled in 3 different modes: using TCL\_UTF\_MAX=3, TCL\_UTF\_MAX=4
or TCL\_UTF\_MAX=6. The first 2 are actually equal now in Tcl 8.7 (since TIP #389). Using
TCL\_UTF\_MAX=6 is actually overkill, since no utf-8 character consists of more than 4 bytes.

Therefore it makes sense to reduce this to only two modes: TCL\_UTF\_MAX=3 means
being fully compatible with Tcl 8.6, while TCL\_UTF\_MAX=4 means compatibility with
the Androwish-version of Tcl. Defining TCL\_UTF\_MAX=6 results in a valid
compilation as well (functioning the same as TCL\_UTF\_MAX=4), only some buffer-sizes
will be 2 bytes larger than necessary.

Androwish made the choice to use an (at that time) un-supported Tcl mode: Changing the size
of the Tcl\_UniChar type using TCL\_UTF\_MAX=6. This causes a binary incompatibility
which results that all extensions need to be re-compiled with TCL\_UTF\_MAX=6 as well.
This TIP proposes to add a supported TCL\_UTF\_MAX=4 compilation mode to Tcl, which has
the same effect as the earlier unsupported TCL\_UTF\_MAX=6, but without the need to
re-compile all extensions. The need for re-compilation of all extensions is eliminated
by putting the 32-bit versions of the Tcl\_UniChar-related functions in different stub
entries than the 16-bit versions. This way, 99% of all extensions compiled with
TCL\_UTF\_MAX=3 keep functioning as before without the need for re-compilation.

The default compilation mode for Tcl will continue to be TCL\_UTF\_MAX=3, which is 100%
upwards compatible with Tcl 8.6.

# Specification

This document proposes:

 * Allow Tcl to be compiled with either -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=3 (default), or with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4.
   In the latter mode, the Tcl_UniChar type becomes a 32-bit type, but the stub entries for
   the 16-bit Tcl\_UniChar type are present as well. So, most extensions compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=3
   will continue to work in either Tcl mode (for caveats, see below).

 * Allow Tcl extensions to be compiled with either -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=3 (default), or with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4,
   when Tcl is compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4.

 * Enhance the Tcl\_UniCharToUtfDString() function such that the uniLength parameter is allowed to
   have the value -1.
 
 * Deprecate the following functions:

     Tcl\_AppendUnicodeToObj()

     Tcl\_GetUnicode()

     Tcl\_GetUnicodeFromObj()

     Tcl\_NewUnicodeObj()

     Tcl\_SetUnicodeObj()

     Tcl\_UniCharCaseMatch()

     Tcl\_UniCharLen()

     Tcl\_UniCharNcmp()

     Tcl\_UniCharNcasecmp()

   If Tcl is compiled with either -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4 or -DTCL\_NO\_DEPRECATED, those functions will no longer be available for extensions, as well as in Tcl 9.0.


 * New functions:
     
     Tcl\_Utf16ToUtfDString()
     
     Tcl\_UtfToUtf16DString()

     Tcl\_UtfToUtf16()

     Those are the same as the _UniChar_ variants, but they use the "unsigned short" type in stead of Tcl\_UniChar.

     Those functions can be used if you want your extension to compile with either -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=3 or -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4,
     but still want to use the 16-bit conversions independent on the TCL\_UTF\_MAX setting or Tcl\_UniChar type.

# Compatibility

As long as Tcl is compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=3, this is fully upwards compatible.

When Tcl is compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4, this is at the Tcl level, compatible with the Androwish-version
of Tcl. At the C-API level, it's upwards compatible with Tcl 8.6 in TCL\_UTF\_MAX=6 mode, except for the
functions marked above as deprecated. Those functions will be gone.

# Caveats

 * Extensions compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4 cannot use any of the deprecated functions mentioned in this TIP.
   Using any of them results in a link error.

 * If Tcl is compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=4, the deprecated functions will be gone. Any
   extension using those, even if the extesion is compiled with -DTCL\_UTF\_MAX=3, won't work any more.
