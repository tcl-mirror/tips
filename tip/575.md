# Abstract

In the original TIP #389 implementation `Tcl_UtfNext()`/`Tcl_UtfPrev()` were able to jump 4 bytes forth and back. This
is contrary to the common expectation and history when `Tcl_UtfNext()`/`Tcl_UtfPrev()` where only able to jump
maximum `TCL_UTF_MAX` bytes. Even though his was never documented, but - given other functions handling `Tcl_UniChar`'s -
a logical expectation. However, it is problematic to allow `Tcl_UtfNext()`/`Tcl_UtfPrev()` to jump to a byte
within a valid 4-byte UTF-8 byte sequence: It means that the pointer points to a continuation byte, which
the caller could interpret as an invalid byte sequence.

# Specification

Implement new functions `Tcl_UtfCharComplete()`/`Tcl_UtfNext()`/`Tcl_UtfPrev()`, which can jump 4 bytes forward resp. back,
so it is possible to jump over characters > U+FFFF in one step in stead of two.

Those 3 functions will get their own new entries in the stub table. So, extensions (however rare) using
`Tcl_UtfNext()`/`Tcl_UtfPrev()` but compiled against Tcl 8.6 headers will keep their original behavior.

The new `Tcl_UtfCharComplete()` will behave almost identical to the old one. The only difference is when it encounters
a starting byte between 0xF0 and 0xF5: It will return true only when at least 4 bytes are available.

If an extension is compiled with `-DTCL_UTF_MAX=4` or with `-DTCL_NO_DEPRECATED`, then `Tcl_UtfCharComplete()` will
start behaving like described in this TIP, if not then it will behave exactly as in Tcl 8.6.
