# Abstract

This TIP proposes a new **expr** math function **isqrt\(\)**.

# Background

With the advent of large integers, Tcl supports taking the square roots of
arguments that lie outside the native floating-point range of the machine.
The square roots are returned as floating point numbers if possible. This
behaviour is correct when floating-point calculations are intended. There are
times, however, when an arbitrary-precision square root is wanted. This root
cannot be obtained by evaluating _entier\(sqrt\($n\)\)_, because _sqrt\($n\)_
has already lost precision.

# Proposed Change

This TIP proposes adding a new math function, _isqrt\($n\)_, that will return
the integer part of the square root of _$n_ to arbitrary precision. The
argument _$n_ must be numeric and non-negative; it may be either integer or
floating-point.

# Reference Implementation

Tcl Feature Request \#1602534 contains a complete reference implementation for
the _isqrt_ function.
