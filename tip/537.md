# Abstract
 
This TIP proposes to modify "struct Tcl\_RegExpInfo" and "struct Tcl\_RegExpIndices, such that the fields indicating indexes change from type "int" to type "size\_t"

# Rationale

This TIP should have been part of TIP #502 (Index Value Reform) and/or TIP #494 (More use of size_t in Tcl 9), but it was overlooked. Without changing this public API, regular expression
indexes never can exceed 2G in value.

# Specification and Documentation

Here are the new struct definitions:
<pre>
typedef struct Tcl\_RegExpInfo {
    size\_t nsubs;
    Tcl_RegExpIndices *matches;
    size\_t extendStart;
} Tcl\_RegExpInfo;

typedef struct Tcl\_RegExpIndices {
    size\_t start;
    size\_t end;
} Tcl\_RegExpIndices;
</pre>

Also a new macro TCL\_INDEX\_NONE will be provided, which is the value of the "start"/"end" fields when there is no match.
This macro will be provided to 8.7 as well, but in Tcl 8.7 it will have the value (-1).

# Implementation

An implementation of this TIP is present in the [regexp-api-64bit](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tcl/timeline?r=regexp-api-64bit) branch.
