# Abstract
 
This TIP proposes to modify `struct Tcl_RegExpInfo` and `struct
Tcl_RegExpIndices`, such that the fields indicating indexes change from type
`int` to type `size_t`.

# Rationale

This TIP should have been part of [TIP #502](502.md) (Index Value Reform) and/or [TIP #494](494.md) (More use of `size_t` in Tcl 9), but it was overlooked. Without changing this public API, regular expression
indexes never can exceed 2GiB in value.

# Specification and Documentation

Here are the new struct definitions:

    typedef struct Tcl_RegExpInfo {
        size_t nsubs;
        Tcl_RegExpIndices *matches;
        size_t extendStart;
    } Tcl_RegExpInfo;
    
    typedef struct Tcl_RegExpIndices {
        size_t start;
        size_t end;
    } Tcl_RegExpIndices;

Also a new macro `TCL_INDEX_NONE` will be provided, which is the value of the
`start` and `end` fields when there is no match.
This macro will be provided to 8.7 as well, but in Tcl 8.7 it will have the value (-1).

# Implementation

An implementation of this TIP is present in the [regexp-api-64bit](/tcl/timeline?r=regexp-api-64bit) branch.
