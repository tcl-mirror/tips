# Abstract

This TIP proposes a way to declare a TclOO method's visibility at definition
time.

# Rationale

TclOO methods are either exported or unexported. By default, methods which name
starts with a lower case letter are exported.  It is possible to override the
default behaviour by a separate call to ***export*** or ***unexport*** at class
definition time. However, this separates the method definition from its
visibility declaration. See the first example in TIP 380 for an example.

# Proposal

This TIP proposes to extend the `method` subcommand of the `oo::define` command
to accept an optional argument to specify its visilibity inline.

    * method name ?option? argList bodyScript

Where ***option*** can be either ***-export*** or ***-unexpor***. If no option
is provided, the default applies.

This change is backwards-compatible, as the new form is not currently valid and
would results in an wrong-number-of-arguments error.

# Implementation

See the `tip-519` branch.
