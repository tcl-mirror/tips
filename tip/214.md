# Abstract

This TIP proposes the new **representation** subcommand to **info**
which returns the internal representation of a variable's contents.

# Rationale

Inspired by a posting on news:comp.lang.tcl by Victor Wagner, I
considered a facility to obtain the internal representation of 
the value of a variable to be useful.

   * It further extends the Tcl introspection commands.

   * It offers a method to check the type of a variable without
     conversion.

   * During the development process it is useful to detect/avoid
     shimmering and its negative performance effects.

# Proposed Change

Add the new subcommand **info representation** with the following
syntax:

 > **info representation** _varName_

It returns the type of the variable _varName_ or an error, if

   * _varName_ doesn't exist,

   * _varName_ is an array and no index is provided,

   * _varName_ is a scalar variable but an index is provided.

# Implementation

A patch against Tcl8.4.6 is available
<http://sf.net/support/tracker.php?aid=1015338> .
