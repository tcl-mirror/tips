# Abstract

This TIP proposes to add full support for all characters in Unicode 10.0\+,
inclusive the characters >= **U\+010000**, even the adaptation in the regexp
engine. Also, the caveats remaining from TIP #389 will be handled here.

# Summary

TODO

# Rationale

TODO

# Specification

This document proposes:

 * Add a new objType "ucs32", which is able to store a string in 32-bits
   per character.

 * Adapt the regexp engine to start using the "ucs32" objType: Any string
   handled by regexp will first be converted to "ucs32".

 * Modify all API using Tcl_UniChar: If the string contains surrogate pairs,
   the "ucs32" objType will used.

 * Modify all functions using or producing an index: "string length <Unicode>"
   should return 1 for all Unicode characters, even the ones >= **U\+010000**
