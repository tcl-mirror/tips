# Abstract

This document explains how strings are represented in Tcl 8.6, 8.7 and 9.0, and how
that affects the Tcl language. When migrating Tcl scripts from 8.6 to 8.7 or 9.0, some
commands slightly change behavior.

This migration guide is based on TIP's [#389](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tips/doc/trunk/tip/389.md),
[#497](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tips/doc/trunk/tip/497.md),
[#542](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tips/doc/trunk/tip/542.md) ...

This TIP is not separately voted on. It will be finalized after Tcl 9.0 is officially released.

# Dual value representation in Tcl.

Tcl strings can internally be represented in two ways, as a sequence of bytes or as
a "Unicode string" (a sequence of Tcl\_UniChar's). This internal representation
differs in the various Tcl versions:

* Tcl 8.5,      bytes: [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) (up to U+FFFF), string: [UCS-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Coded_Character_Set)
* Tcl 8.6,      bytes: [CESU-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CESU-8),          string: [UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16)
* Tcl 8.7,      bytes: [WTF-8](https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/),           string: [UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16)
* Tcl 9.0,      bytes: [WTF-8](https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/),           string: [UTF-32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-32)

The difference in behavior, comparing the different Tcl versions, can be explained by this
difference in internal representation of strings.

Remark: Actually, Tcl uses a variation of UTF-8/CESU-8/WTF-8 in which the NULL character is represented as two bytes 0xC0 0x80.
This variation is known as [Modified UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Modified_UTF-8). Tcl uses the same
modification for CESU-8 and WTF-8 as well. Since this modification holds for all Tcl versions, it's not significant
for this document.

Remark 2:  Since utf-8 is the system encoding on most modern UNIX (and MacOS) systems, the examples below can only
be used on UNIX and MacOS, not when using tclsh interactive on Windows (for example).

# encoding "utf-8"

In Tcl 8.6 and 8.7, Emoji are represented internally as two codepoints. So
<pre>
$ tclsh8.6
% encoding convertfrom utf-8 \\xF0\\x9F\\xA4\\x9D
🤝
% string length [encoding convertfrom utf-8 \\xF0\\x9F\\xA4\\x9D]
2
</pre>

Since Tcl 9.0 switches to UTF-32 for counting the string length:
<pre>
$ tclsh9.0
% encoding convertfrom utf-8 \xF0\x9F\xA4\x9D
🤝
% string length [encoding convertfrom utf-8 \\xF0\\x9F\\xA4\\x9D]
1
</pre>

Tcl 8.5 (and also Tcl 8.6 earlier than 8.6.10) was not able to handle this
at all:
<pre>
$ tclsh8.5
% encoding convertfrom utf-8 \\xF0\\x9F\\xA4\\x9D
ð¤ <i>(control characters \\x9F and \\x9D are not printable)</i>
% string length [encoding convertfrom utf-8 \\xF0\\x9F\\xA4\\x9D]
4
</pre>
Any 4-byte utf-8 sequence was simply converted to those separate 4 bytes.
This made the use of Emoji practially impossible when using Tcl 8.6.9 or earlier.

# escaping

In Tcl 8.6, using a system encoding different from UTF-8, you cannot use
Emoji directly in scripts. The only portable way to use them is
the \\u???? construct:
<pre>
$ tclsh8.6
% puts \\uD83E\\uDD1D
🤝
% string length \\uD83E\\uDD1D
2
</pre>

In Tcl 9.0 this is still supported, but it might be that a future TIP prohibits this:
<pre>
$ tclsh9.0
% puts \\uD83E\\uDD1D
🤝
% string length \\uD83E\\uDD1D
1
</pre>
Note that this escape sequence appears to produce 2 symbols, a higher and
a lower surrogate. But surrogate pairs are non-conforming in WTF-8, so they are
joined into a single 4-byte sequence right from the start.

Better is to use the 🤝 character directly:
<pre>
$ tclsh9.0
% puts 🤝
🤝
% string length 🤝
1
</pre>


# string compare

Since in Tcl 8.6, Emoji are represented internally as two codepoints:
<pre>
$ tclsh8.6
% string compare 🤝 豈
-1
</pre>
But in Tcl 8.7 and 9.0:
<pre>
$ tclsh8.7
% string compare 🤝 豈
1
</pre>

The reason for this is that 🤝 (U+1F91D) is internally represented as two code-points (U+D83E U+DD1D) while 豈 is
represented as a single code point (U+F900). The "string compare" simply compares all code points from left
to right, and concludes that 🤝 is smaller than 豈, which - in unicode sense - (U+1F91D > U+F900) is not
correct. This is corrected in Tcl 8.7 and 9.0.

Conclusion: When Tcl8.6 strings contain both Emoji and characters between U+E000 and U+FFFF (mostly Private Use,
but also CJK Compatibility Ideographs, Alphabetic presentation forms, Arabic presentation forms, Variation selectors,
Vertical forms, Combining half-marks, CJK Compatibility forms, Small form variants, Halfwidth and Fullwith forms, Specials)
string comparison might not give what you expect.

# string index / string length

In Tcl 8.6 and 8.7:
<pre>
$ tclsh8.6
% string length 🤝
2
</pre>
But in Tcl 9.0:
<pre>
$ tclsh9.0
% string length 🤝
1
</pre>

Since the "string length" and the "string index" command are related, we cannot
change one without taking the other into account. Therefore, "string index"
behaves differently in the 3 different Tcl version. For example:

In Tcl 8.6
<pre>
$ tclsh8.6
% string index 🤝🤡 0
&#55358; <i>(U+D83E)</i>
% string index 🤝🤡 1
&#56605; <i>(U+DD1D)</i>
</pre>
In Tcl 8.7
<pre>
$ tclsh8.7
% string index 🤝🤡 0
🤝
% string index 🤝🤡 1
 <i>(empty string)</i>
% string index 🤝🤡 2
🤡
% string index 🤝🤡 3
 <i>(empty string)</i>
</pre>
In Tcl 9.0
<pre>
$ tclsh9.0
% string index 🤝🤡 0
🤝
% string index 🤝🤡 1
🤡
</pre>

This allows looping through the string using "string length" in
combination with "string index". But if the index points to an Emoji, Tcl 8.7
returns the full Emoji while Tcl 8.6 returns the upper surrogate only. If the index
points to the lower surrogate of an Emoji, "string index" will return the empty
string in Tcl 8.7.

In Tcl 9.0 all is OK: Since "string length 🤝" is 1, no special handling is
needed when indexing strings.

# split

Since Emoji are not supposed to be split into surrogates:
<pre>
$ tclsh8.6 <i>(at least 8.6.11)</i>
% split 🤝🤡 {}
🤝 🤡
</pre>

Earlier Tcl versions (even up to 8.6.9):
<pre>
$ tclsh8.5
% split 🤝🤡 {}
ð  ¤  ð  ¤ ¡
</pre>

In Tcl 8.6.10 it was partially fixed:
<pre>
$ tclsh8.6
% split 🤝🤡 {}
&#55358; &#56605; &#55358; &#56609; <i>(U+D83E U+DD1D U+D83E U+DD21)</i>
</pre>

This means that - starting with Tcl 8.6.11 - "split" can be used to
iterate over a string, respecting correct border for Emoji. But it
could have unexpected effects. For example the "tcl-telegram" app
has the following function to convert a Tcl string to json form:
<pre>
&#35; Convert TCL string to proper JSON string
proc jString {str} {
	set result ""
	&#35; json::write does escaping for 8-bit characters and adds quotes, but doesn't handle unicode
	set str [json::write string [subst -nocommands -novariables $str]]
	&#35; Convert everything non 8-bit to \\uXXXX sequences
	foreach char [split $str {}] {
		scan $char %c code
		if {$code > 127} {
			append result [format "\\\\u%04.4x" $code]
		} else {
			append result $char
		}
	}
	return $result
}
</pre>

Originally this function couldn't handle Emoji (since Tcl up to 8.6.9 couldn't).
In Tcl 8.6.10 it started working for Emoji (since json expects Emoji to
be converted to surrogate-pairs first). Starting with Tcl 8.6.11 it should (finally) be written as follows:

<pre>
&#35; Convert TCL string to proper JSON string
proc jString {str} {
	set result ""
	&#35; json::write does escaping for 8-bit characters and adds quotes, but doesn't handle unicode
	set str [json::write string [subst -nocommands -novariables $str]]
	&#35; Convert everything non 8-bit to \uXXXX sequences
	foreach char [split $str {}] {
		scan $char %c code
		if {$code > 65535} {
			&#35; split $code into surrogates first
			append result [format "\\u%04.4x\\u%04.4x" \
				[expr {(($code-0x10000)>>10)+0xD800}] [expr {(($code-0x10000)&0x3FF)+0xDC00}]]
		} elif {$code > 127} {
			append result [format "\\u%04.4x" $code]
		} else {
			append result $char
		}
	}
	return $result
}
</pre>

This version works for Tcl 8.6.10 too, and it will continue to work for Tcl 8.7 and 9.0.
