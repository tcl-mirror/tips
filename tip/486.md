# Abstract

The "thread" package became an essential part of Tcl. In order to keep functioning
in Tcl 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6, a lot of trickery has been introduced, which cannot
be maintained indefinitely. This should all be removed eventually.

Therefore, this TIP suggests to continue the development of Thread 2.8, which is
meant for Tcl 8.x, but also develop Thread 3.0 which is meant to function with
Tcl 9 only. On the script level they will be upwards compatible. The major version
number is used to tell the difference.

# Proposed Change

Thread 3.0 will be upwards compatible with Thread 2.8. The difference between Thread 3.0
and Thread 2.8 will be that Thread 3.0 will run on Tcl 9.0 only, while Thread 2.x will
run on Tcl 8.x only. All functionality which keeps Thread running on Tcl 8.x will be
removed in Thread 3.0, but at the script level everything will be 100% upwards compatible.

# Implementation

An implementation of this TIP can be found in the [novem](https://core.tcl.tk/thread/timeline?r=novem) branch.
