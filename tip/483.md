# Abstract

The TIP #59 implementation for Tk is incomplete.
This TIP proposes a more complete TIP #59 implementation for Tk.

# Rationale

There is currently only one key (_fontsystem_) provided by `::tk::pkgconfig`,
which will contain the value _xft_ only if xft was enabled at configure-time,
requiring a `[catch]`-wrapping of any `[::tk::pkgconfig get fontsystem]` calls.

# Proposal

* Use the value _x11_ for the _fontsystem_ key if xft wasn't enabled at configure-time,

* Add to `::tk::pkgconfig` a group of keys/values analagous to those provided by Tcl.

# Reference Implementation

The reference implementation is available in the tk-stu-pkg branch. <http://core.tcl.tk/tk/timeline?r=tk-stu-pkg>

The code is licensed under the same license as Tk.
