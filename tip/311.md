# Abstract

This TIP serves to coordinate Tcl/Tk 8.6 development releases and the features
they deliver.

# Introduction

Following up on a message to the 'tcl-core@lists.sourceforge.net' mailing
list, <http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/tcl-core/3594952> , a
draft release calendar for Tcl/Tk 8.6 alpha and beta releases is presented
below.

The intent is for developers working on Tcl and Tk to add under each release
date those features they intend to make part of that release. For features
which already are described by another TIP, a reference to that TIP is
sufficient, and the recommended way to update this page. For features which
have not yet been TIPped, a brief description and the names of those actively
working on it are an acceptable temporary replacement, but should be replaced
with a TIP reference as soon as one is ready.

This is meant to be a working document, which gets updated by all stakeholders
to reflect ongoing progress and any changes of plan. It's not a contract or a
promise, just a place to record the intents of an entire community of
developers. Anything in it might be revised, and any intent expressed in it
might well not be fulfilled.  Due to its nature, there will never be any vote
on this TIP. It is more analogous to similar informational TIPs like [[31]](31.md).
