# Abstract

This TIP adds a write-only option for delivering a signal to the processes in
a pipeline it has created.

# Rationale

Although Tcl has long had a way for pipelines to be created (via the right
incantation to **open**) and their process IDs retrieved (with `pid $pipe`),
and gained the ability to partially close a bidirectional pipeline with
[TIP #332](332.md), it lacks a mechanism for sending a signal to the pipeline.
Binding this capability to the pipeline, rather than making it work for
general process IDs, means that user scripts can work at the level of
pipelines and not pay too much attention to their components.

This TIP does not provide support for doing the same thing on Windows, where
the types of signals (and other related events) are substantially different.

# Specification

Pipeline channels shall gain an extra _set-only_ **chan configure**
option, **-signal**, which may be set to send the indicated signal to all the
processes in the pipeline that Tcl knows about (i.e., those returned by `pid
$pipe`). The signal to send may be specified as either a positive number or a
_case-insensitive_ signal name (with or without the `SIG` prefix), with the
set of supported signal names being system-specific (but the “well-known”
set).

The effect of the signal on the pipeline is out of scope.

# Example

This creates a (very silly!) pipeline, lets it run for 5 seconds, kills it
with a terminate signal, then reads all the output (if any):

    set pipe [open |[list cat /dev/random | grep fish]]
    after 5000
    chan configure $pipe -signal SIGTERM
    # Also legal: -signal 15 or -signal TERM or -signal sigterm
    set output [read $pipe]
    catch {close $pipe}
