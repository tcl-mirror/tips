Michael Laudrup says his Swansea side were deserving of the point picked up in their goalless draw against Liverpool.
"In the first half they had more chances than us but we had chances too and I am pleased with the performance.
The draw sees Laudrup's men record their first clean sheet since August and remain above Liverpool having lost just one of their last eight games.
