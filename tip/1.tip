~ Explanations and How To Submit New TIPs

See [2] for a description of the editorial process a TIP has to go
through and [3] for a description of their structure and the commands
used to write them. You submit a TIP to this archive by emailing it
(preferably in source form) to the TIP editor <donal.fellows@cs.man.ac.uk>
who will check it for following of the guidelines, style and general
relevance to Tcl/Tk before checking it into the CVS archive and notifying
the author, the rest of the Tcl Core Team, and the relevant newsgroups.
