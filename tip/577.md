# Abstract

Various commands handle errors in "index" values differently. This TIP attempts to treat the different
uses of index values (in both Tcl and Tk) to a more uniform way.

# Rationale

Some examples (Tk):
<pre>
$ wish8.6
% listbox .l
% menu .m
% .l index 0
0
% .l index none
bad listbox index "none": must be active, anchor, end, @x,y, or a number
% .m index none
none
% .m index 0
none
% .m index foo
bad menu entry index "foo"
</pre>

More examples (Tcl):
<pre>
$ tclsh8.6
% lreplace {a b c} -1 -1 d
d a b c
% lreplace {a b c} -2 -2 d
d a b c
% set x {a b c}
a b c
% lset x 0 d
d b c
% lset x -1 d
list index out of range
</pre>

# Specification

  * The C function `Tcl_GetIntForIndex()` will get an additional `flags` parameter, which holds any combination of
    3 possible flags (could be extended further in the future):
      - `TCL_INDEX_ERROR`: Handle `-2` (and lower) and `end+2` (and higher) as invalid index.
      - `TCL_INDEX_NOMIN`: Handle `-1` as invalid index (when `TCL_INDEX_ERROR` is set), or as the same as index "0".
      - `TCL_INDEX_NOMAX`: Handle `end+1` as invalid index (when `TCL_INDEX_ERROR` is set), or as the same as index "end".
    The default flag value 0, will behave as-is now, accepting all forms as valid. Starting with Tcl 9.0,
    all internal `Tcl_GetIntForIndex()` calls will at least supply the `TCL_INDEX_ERROR` flag value
    to this function.
  * Values "none" and "" (empty string) are now valid indices, representing "just before the first".
    Commands that accept either a single index or a list of indices will handle the empty string as empty list,
    not as a single index.
  * New functions "string is none" and "string is index". 
  * Starting with Tcl 9.0, integers < `-1` and forms `end+x` where x > 1 will no longer be valid indexes any more.
    Various commands use `-1` to indicate "just before the first" and `end+1` for "just after the last",
    those usages will continue to be work as it worked before.
  * For Tk, start accepting all those same values as indices for entries, listboxes, menus .....
    and also for button and menu-related `-underline` options. A new TK_OPTION_INDEX option is implemented,
    which is almost the same as TK_OPTION_INT, but in stead of only integers, accepts all index forms as well.

# Compatibility

For Tcl 8.7 this is almost 100% compatible, previous error-situations become valid now:
Index value `none` can now be used in place of `-1`, just as the empty string "".

Since, starting with Tcl 9.0, some index forms are no longer valid, this is a potential
incompatibility. Indices like `-2` and `end+2` can no longer be used in scripts: they
will immediately result in an "index out of range" error, in stead of being silently ignore.
