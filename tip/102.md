# Abstract

This TIP proposes to change the name of the introspection subcommand
of the _trace_ command from _list_ to _info_.

# Rationale

Although the functionality of the _trace_ command \(as extended by
[[62]](62.md)\) is good, the name of the introspection subcommand, _list_ is
not such a good choice:

 * The name _info_ is already well known for introspection purposes
   in Tcl \(e.g. [info] and [after info].\)

 * The name [trace list] could be misunderstood as having to do with
   tracing lists.

 * The introspection subcommand to trace could be extended to allow
   more specific queries along the lines of [info commands], [info
   procs], and [info vars].  _\(This is outside the scope of this
   TIP.\)_

Hence, this TIP calls for the _list_ subcommand to be renamed to
_info_.  \(Note that this also makes the subcommand for introspecting
on variable traces more similar to its old form _vinfo_.\)
