# Abstract

Package **msgcat** implements message catalogues for packages organized in nested namespaces.
This TIP defines an extension for TCLOO.

# Rationale

Since TCLOO was included in the core, packages may also be defined as TCLOO classes.
The **msgcat** package should feature an extension to support this.
