# Abstract

This TIP proposes the addition of a new argument to the Tk command
**selection**, for specifying a timestamp that should be used in order to
retrieve a selection.

# Rationale

TkDND 2.x always used the **selection** command to retrieve data from the
clipboard, and worked until recently. The problem seems to be that the
selection Tk command always uses "_CurrentTime_" while retrieving the
selection, while the XDND protocol specifies that a specific timestamp should
be used.

I see that in Tk sources \(_unix/tkUnixSelect.c_, line 178, the call to
_XConvertSelection_\) there is already some discussion in the comments which
timestamp should be used. The "_CurrentTime_" seems a good choice, but why
not offer the ability to provide a timestamp if needed?

# Proposed Change

Add a new option to **selection get**. Something like this:

 > **selection get** ?**-displayof** _window_? ?**-selection**
   _selection_? ?**-type** _type_? ?**-time** _time_?

The _time_ value will be an integer, the same as in the **-time** option
to **event generate** and as produced by the **%t** substitution in
**bind**.
