# Abstract

This TIP changes the semantics of Tcl and TclOO so that objects can be
reclaimed automatically when they are no longer referenced.

# Rationale

One of the use patterns that people use TclOO for is to create relatively
short-lived objects that manage other things. Currently doing this requires
remembering to explicitly delete the objects once they are no longer needed,
usually by calling their `destroy` method, but this is comparatively
onerous. If we instead adopt a garbage collection mechanism, we can move
instead to deleting objects once they are no longer referenced by the rest of
the program; this is a reasonable fit for objects whose name is not
predetermined, as their name needs to be saved into a variable (or put inside
a list or other data-containing value) already in order for them to be usable.

# Specification

When the `new` method of `oo::class` is called, it picks a new unused name
currently. This behaviour shall be extended so that when the final reference
from Tcl code to that name is lost (which shall be determined through
mechanisms such as reference counting) the object will be deleted.

Each use of `self object` (or its common alias `self`) within the object shall
create another reference to the object. Looking it up through mechanisms such
as `info class instances` shall create another reference to the object (while
it exists).

Instances may also be explicitly deleted through all existing mechanisms.
After that, those existing references will be treated as if they were plain
strings.

# Implementation

To be done.
