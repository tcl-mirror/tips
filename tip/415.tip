~ Abstract

Creating a segment of a circular arc is unnecessarily difficult using the
'''canvas''' arc. This TIP proposes a simple extension of the syntax to
support the creation of circular arc segments in a natural way. A similar
extension to support the more general elliptical arc segments is outside the
scope of this TIP.
