## Abstract

This TIP proposes a new command `timerate` as well as a measurement toolchain for TCL.

In order for it to be possibile to compare results among older Tcl versions, the version 8.5 is suggested as a target version for this TIP.
(To forestall the objection that this TIP extends old versions, the command `timerate` shall be placed into `::tcl::unsupported ` namespace in versions prior to 8.7; this makes the TIP be formally for 8.7.)

Additionally, this TIP proposes-optionally-a small framework to test performance. This makes possible to create test scripts for
possible performance regressions and allows a `diff`-based comparison of the results to find performance degradation between revisions.

## Rationale

Although the existing command `time` can be used for performance measurement, it has several disadvantages:

 1. The execution is limited by fixed repetition count, so the real execution time is undefined (if the evaluation time of single iteration is unknown or may vary in time in different versions). The time neede by a test case could grow to be very great.
 2. `time` does not have a calibration ability.
 3. `time` uses the default script invocation function (`Tcl_EvalObjEx`), therefore the speed of the script is different from that of compiled byte-code (_e.g._ in a compiled procedure),
 4. In addition measurement is very imprecise on extremely fast scripts, because of certain unadvoidable overhead costs (the execution of `time` and the interpreter overhead up to the `TclNRRunCallbacks` call that invokes `TEBCResume` for a compiled script).
 5. `time` introduces additional external costs on the script being measured, such as washout of the CPU-cache and branch misprediction.

## I. Proposed command: `timerate`

	timerate - Time-related execution resp. performance measurement of a script

### Synopsis

	timerate script ?time ?max-count??

	timerate ?-direct? ?-overhead double? script ?time ?max-count??

	timerate ?-calibrate? ?-direct? script ?time ?max-count??

### Description

The first and second form will evaluate script until the interval `time` given in milliseconds elapses, or for 1000 milliseconds (1 second) if `time` is not specified.
The parameter `max-count` could additionally impose a further restriction by the maximal number of iterations to evaluate the script.
If `max-count` is specified, the evalution will stop either this count of iterations is reached or the time is exceeded.

It will then return a canonical tcl-list of the form (similar to command `time` but more expressive):

	.095977 Âµs/# 52095836 # 10419167 #/sec 5000.000 nett-ms

which indicates:

       - the average amount of time required per iteration, in microseconds (`lindex $result 0`)

       - the count how many times it was executed (`lindex $result 2`)

       - the estimated rate per second (`lindex $result 4`)

       - the estimated real execution time without measurement overhead (`lindex $result 6`)

Time is measured in elapsed time using the finest timer resolution as possible, not CPU time.
This command may be used to provide information as to how well the script or a tcl-command is performing and can help determine bottlenecks and fine-tune application performance.

As opposed to the `time` commmand, which runs the tested script for a fixed
number of iterations, the `timerate` command runs it for a fixed time.
Additionally, the compiled variant of the script will be used during the entire measurement, as if the script were part of a compiled procedure,
if the `-direct` option is not specified.
The fixed time period and possibility of compilation allow for  more precise results and prevent very long execution times by slow scripts, making it practical for measuring scripts with highly uncertain execution times.

To measure very fast scripts as precisely as posible the calibration process may be required.

### Options

`-calibrate`

The `-calibrate` option is used to calibrate `timerate`, calculating the estimated overhead of the given script as the default overhead for future invocations of the `timerate` command. If the `time` parameter is not specified, the `-calibrate` procedure runs for up to 10 seconds.

`-overhead` _double_

The `-overhead` parameter supplies an estimate (in microseconds) of the measurement overhead of each iteration of the tested script. This quantity will be subtracted from the measured time prior to reporting results.

`-direct`

The `-direct` option causes direct execution of the supplied script, without compilation, in a manner similar to the `time` command. It can be used to measure the cost of `Tcl_EvalObjEx`, of the invocation of canonical lists, and of the uncompiled versions of bytecoded commands.

### Examples

Estimate how fast it takes for a simple Tcl `for` loop (including operations on variable `i`) to count to ten:

	# calibrate:
	timerate -calibrate {}
	# measure:
	timerate { for {set i 0} {$i<10} {incr i} {} } 5000

Estimate how fast it takes for a simple Tcl `for` loop, ignoring the overhead for to perform ten iterations, ignoring the overhead of the management of the variable that controls the loop:

	# calibrate for overhead of variable operations:
	set i 0; timerate -calibrate {expr {$i<10}; incr i} 1000 
	# measure:
	timerate { for {set i 0} {$i<10} {incr i} {} } 5000

Estimate the speed of calculating the hour of the day using `clock format` only, ignoring overhead of the portion of the script that prepares the time for it to calculate:

	# calibrate:
	timerate -calibrate {}
	# estimate overhead:
	set tm 0
	set ovh [lindex [timerate { incr tm [expr {24*60*60}] }] 0]
	# measure using esimated overhead:
	set tm 0
	timerate -overhead $ovh {
	  clock format $tm -format %H
	  incr tm [expr {24*60*60}]; # overhead for this is ignored
	} 5000

### Impact

As the current implementation in [sebres-8-6-timerate](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tcl/timeline?n=100&r=sebres-8-6-timerate) 
(or, for Tcl 8.5, [sebres-8-5-timerate](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tcl/timeline?n=100&r=sebres-8-5-timerate)) shows, no public API's are affected by introducing this,
A few new functions are provided for Tcl's internal API (see `tclInt.h`).

Don Porter (`dgp`) has made a review of the version of this change that  targets Tcl 8.7, which can be found in branch [dgp-sebres-timerate-review](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tcl/timeline?n=100&r=dgp-sebres-timerate-review).
The branch already contains the performance testing  framework as well as a new script, `tests-perf/clock.perf.tcl` that instruments the `clock` command in preparation for integrating changes that improve its performance..

<hr/>
## II. Proposed performance-testing framework: `::tclTestPerf`

The small test suite in the `::tclTestPerf` namespace allows for batch-based measurement and diff-based results
to compare performamnce among revisions and detect performance regressions.

### Synopsis

	::tclTestPerf::_test_run time scripts

*The reason why this command is called `_test_run` was the intention to extend later this functionality with `test` command
(to provide similar functionality of tcltest-package for performance measurement resp. to melt both packages at some point)*

The `_test_run` command executes a batch of scripts provided in the syntax of a Tcl list, with the exception that rows may be commented using Tcl's `#` syntax.
It produces an output, that can be used for automated comparison of perfomance measurements.
When uncommented elements of the script are executed, an output is produced that is similar to the transcript of a `tclsh` session. The output for each element consists of:
 * a line consisting of the string, '% ', followed by the element being evaluated.
 * a line containing the result returned by evaluating the given element.
 * a line containing the result of applying `timerate` to the given element.
 
The special tokens, `setup` and `cleanup`, can be used to specify actions
needed to initialize and finalize the test sequence before and after
conducting the measurements; for example:

	::tclTestPerf::_test_run 500 {
	  setup {set i 0}
	  {clock format [incr i] -format "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" \
	       -locale en -timezone :CET}
	  cleanup {unset i}
	  ...
	}

It is recommended that the programmer divide multiple scripts into several blocks, because each block produces a separate summary output at end of execution, 
which contains the total, average, min and max time of execution of the script that the block contains, making it easier to identify which specific element has suffered from a performance regression.

### Usage as test-script

	## common test performance framework:
	if {![namespace exists ::tclTestPerf]} {
	  source [file join [file dirname [info script]] test-performance.tcl]
	}

	## test namespace:
	namespace eval ::tclTestPerf-Example {

	namespace path {::tclTestPerf}

	## set testing defaults:
	set ::env(TCL_TZ) :CET

	## warm-up test-related features (load clock.tcl, system zones, locales, etc.):
	clock scan "" -gmt 1
	clock scan ""
	clock scan "" -timezone :CET

	proc test-format {{reptime 1000}} {
	  _test_run $reptime {
	    # Format : short, week only (in gmt)

	  }
	}

	proc test-scan {{reptime 1000}} {
	  _test_run $reptime {
	    # Scan : date (in gmt)
	    {clock scan "25.11.2015" -format "%d.%m.%Y" -base 0 -gmt 1}
	    # Scan : date (system time zone, with base)
	    {clock scan "25.11.2015" -format "%d.%m.%Y" -base 0}
	    # Scan : date (system time zone, without base)
	    {clock scan "25.11.2015" -format "%d.%m.%Y"}
	  }
	}

	proc test {{reptime 1000}} {
	  puts ""
	  test-format $reptime
	  test-scan $reptime
	  puts \n**OK**
	}

	}; #/::tclTestPerf-Example

	if {[info exists ::argv0] && [file tail $::argv0] eq [file tail [info script]]} {
	  array set in {-time 500}
	  array set in $::argv
	  ::tclTestPerf-Example::test $in(-time)
