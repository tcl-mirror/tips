# Abstract

The aim of this TIP is to implement a mechanism to specify the procedure argrument call types (call by name vs. value), so that no need to use upvar commands to be able to pass the arguments by names.

The important thing in this feature is to preserve the backward compatibility and not to change the procedure definition signature (proc \<name\> \<args\> \<body\>).
