# Abstract

Tcl OO provides a native OO system for Tcl.  This TIP is to enhance it to meet some of the common expectations of people comming in from other languages.

# Rationale

Most other OO systems provide for class variables which are accessable and sahred by all members of a class and class methods which only have access to
class variable and not to instance/object varaiables.  They also provide a way to initialize the class variables.  This TIP seeks to add them into Tcl OO.

# Proposal

The proposal is to add some or all of the functionality of oo::util, in particular the classvariable and classmethod.
Additionally, it is proposed to add an initialise class definition command to all the initialization of class variables.

# Reference Implementation

Reference implementations are mentioned in the proposal section. Additionally, this is a reference implementation for initialise:
<code>
  proc ::oo::define::initialise {body} {
      if {[package vsatisfies [package require Tcl] 8.7]} {
          set cls [uplevel 1 self]
      } else {
          set cls [lindex [info level -1] 1]
      }
      tailcall apply [list {} $body [info object namespace $cls]]
  }
</code>
