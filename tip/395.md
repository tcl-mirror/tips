# Abstract

The **string is** command supports tests for a number of Tcl's basic types,
for example, integers, doubles, and booleans. One common case is missing:
checking if a value is an integer number without particular storage width,
unlike **string is integer** and **string is wideinteger**. This document
proposes to augment the **string is** command with a **string is entier**.

# Rationale

Tcl makes it easy to work with integers larger than 64 bit \(big nums\). The
**expr** command supports operations on unlimited bit widths. Checking if a
string contains a valid integer value is possible with the **string is
integer** and **string is wideinteger** commands for integers of particular
storage widths \(e.g. 32 bit for integers and 64 bit for wide integers\). But
checking if a string contains a valid integer wider than a **wideinteger**
is not possible with a **string is** command. Checking if a string contains
a valid big num can now be done with a regular expression or by
**catch**-ing the **::tcl::mathfunc::entier** function.

# Specification

This document proposes to augment the **string is** command with a **string
is entier** which functions the same as **string is integer** in every
respect except for the fact that it accepts any string containing a substring
that is valid as a bignum integer \(that is, acceptable to
_Tcl\_GetBignumFromObj_\) possibly surrounded by whitespace.

# Compatibility

No incompatibilities are introduced.

# Alternatives

The **bignum** was rejected in favor of **entier** because **entier** is
already used in **::tcl::mathfunc::entier**.
