~Abstract

This TIP describes an extension of the command-line options to the
"wish" and "tclsh" programs to allow the startup script to be
redirected from the default ~/.wishrc (or ~/.tclshrc) to an
alternative file.

~Rationale

It is possible to run an application from a terminal that starts up a
GUI or other event-based process but that, after setting up the event
callback procedures, drops back into the terminal to allow a
dual-input interface.  As written, the only way to execute a script
and return to the interpreter prompt in the terminal is to put the
script in the ".wishrc" or ".tclshrc" startup script.  One has to bend
over backwards to write an application that will make this happen
without actually changing the user's startup scripts.  The shell
script must redefine environment variable ''$HOME'' to point to the
place where the script is that needs to be run, and the script itself
then must be named ".wishrc" or ".tclshrc", or must have a symbolic
link of that name pointing to it.  The ''$HOME'' environment variable
must be copied to another variable name if the application needs to
reference the original value.

All this can be avoided by simply having a shell command-line option
"'''-startup''' ''filename''" that allows the specification of a name
other than ".wishrc" or ".tclshrc" in a directory path that is not
necessarily the user's home directory, to be used as the startup
script.  This would not only be useful for the purpose outlined above,
but also to simply bypass whatever commands are executed by the
default startup script.

~Specification

The command-line option for "wish" and "tclsh" would be extended to
add the option '''-startup''', for example:

 > '''wish -startup''' ''filename'' [''other options'']
