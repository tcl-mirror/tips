# Abstract

This TIP proposes to rename some package name to lowercase, and
recommend lowercase packagenames.

# Rationale

Let's run the "package names" command. Possible outcome:

<pre>
    % package names
    Thread http tcl::tommath TclOO tcl::idna opt tcltest zipfs cookiejar msgcat zlib Ttrace Tcl platform sqlite3 Tk
</pre>

From this, we cannot really see where those packages came from.
Some are distributed from within Tcl (tcl::tommath, zlib, TclOO, zipfs), some
are distributed as tm modules (http, msgcat, platform), some
are in the battery-included Tcl distribution (Thread, Ttrace, sqlite3).

# Specification

* In order to bring some consistency in package names, this
TIP proposes to rename some packages. The old package names
are kept as well.

    - TclOO   ⟶  tcl::oo
    - zipfs   ⟶  tcl::zipfs
    - zlib    ⟶  tcl::zlib
    - Tcl     ⟶  tcl
    - Tcltest ⟶  tcl::test
    - Tk      ⟶  tk
    - Tktest  ⟶  tk::test

This means that both "package require tcl" and "package require Tcl"
can be used interchangably. But "package require TCL" won't work.
The old names will be deprecated, but not removed, not even in Tcl 9.0.

* From now on, the recommended way to name packages is lowercase.

# Caveat

The "load" and "unload" command have an optional `?packageName?` argument,
which isn't actually a packageName at all. It's more like a prefix, which
is title-cased and appended with "\_Init" (or "\_Unload") for determining
the initialization function of the loaded library. There's a separate
[ticket](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tcl/tktview?name=ea39ab591e)
on that. That's why the "load" and "unload" still use Titlecase
arguments like "Tk", not "tk". Originally, solving this was part
of this TIP, but it's out of scope now: It's not necessary to
make the transition to lowercase package names, so this can be
solved separately later.

The same holds for the _packageName_ argument of the
`Tcl_StaticPackage()` function, this argument
should still be Titlecase as well.

# Compatibility

This is 100% compatible with Tcl 8.5/8.6. UPPERCASE or
Titlecase package names still work as before.

# Reference Implementation

In tcl branch "tip-590". Tk has its "tip-590" branch too.
