# Abstract

This TIP proposes a revision to **Tcl\_GetBignumAndClearObj** to make it
easier to use.

# Background

**Tcl\_GetBignumAndClearObj** was added by [[237]](237.md). Because _mp\_int_ values
can be big, the interface is offered to avoid making a copy when the value
already in the internal representation of an unshared _Tcl\_Obj_ will no
longer be needed and can be moved instead of copied.

The basic intent was fine, but in practice, callers must go through these
gymnastics to use it:

	 if (Tcl_IsShared(objPtr)) {
	     Tcl_GetBignumFromObj(interp, objPtr, &bigValue);
	 } else {
	     Tcl_GetBignumAndClearObj(interp, objPtr, &bigValue);
	 }

It would make for a much more pleasant interface to move the test for a shared
value into the routine itself.

# Proposed Change

When passed a shared _objPtr_, **Tcl\_GetBignumAndClearObj** will no longer
panic, but will fall back to the copying behavior of
**Tcl\_GetBignumFromObj**. The use of the **Tcl\_GetBignumAndClearObj**
interface by a caller no longer means an assertion that _objPtr_ is
unshared, and no longer guarantees that _objPtr_ will in fact be cleared,
but merely indicates the caller will not be using the value anymore, and does
not mind if it is cleared. That's all the caller should care about anyway.

Because of these changes in the implications and guarantees,
the function is also renamed to **Tcl\_TakeBignumFromObj**.

With these changes, the code above may be simplified to:

	 Tcl_TakeBignumFromObj(interp, objPtr, &bigValue);

# Compatibility

This is a incompatible change only with 8.5 alpha releases.
