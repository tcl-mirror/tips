# Abstract

This TIP extends the **string trim**, **string trimleft**, and **string
trimright** subcommands to function properly with non-roman writing systems
by adding non-ASCII space characters to the default list of characters to be
trimmed.

# Rationale

By default **string trim** and its single-sided variants remove ASCII
whitespace characters. Some writing systems use other whitespace characters.
Adding these characters to the default list will extend the
Unicode-friendliness of Tcl.

The characters proposed to be added are:

	U+1361  ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE       
	U+1680  OGHAM SPACE MARK
	U+3000  IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE
